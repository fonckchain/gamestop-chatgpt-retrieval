The Gamma Squeeze part II - March 23, 2022

 Due Diligence

TL;DR - The option chain is lining up with massive consequences at / after $150. I believe the price suppression

is being targeted at specific strike prices to avoid another gamma squeeze from happening before Friday 3/25. If

you see resistances at those points, it could be because these OTM call sellers got caught with their pants

down. #LFG

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!DAMN IT, WHAT A WEEK SO

FAR!

I wanted to throw my 2-cents in on our current situation and explain why I think $150 is a very important price-point.

I don't wanna get too far into the weeds on options trading, but they are having a significant impact on the price action

around $150 right now. For those of you that were here back in January 2021, you will probably recall we had

significant... I MEAN SIGNIFICANT.... OTM call options that suddenly became ITM when the price started skyrocketing.

This causes a chain reaction because the seller of the call option is now required to go into the market and purchase the

security for the buyer once the market price reaches the strike price and the option is exercised.

This obviously assumes the seller doesn't have the share at that moment and the call owner exercises the option

immediately. Usually, the option owner waits for the price to go up even higher before the option is exercised. The higher

it goes, the deeper in the money the option becomes. When the price goes up really fast and these options are

exercised, it forces something called a gamma squeeze...

...So basically.... on top of retail investors who are FOMO buying during a price spike, the added pressure of buying

shares to cover those ITM call options adds nitrous oxide to the rocket.

The advantage of selling OTM calls is that you can collect premiums from the sale of the option without having to buy the
underlying security as long as the strike price is never met or the option expires.. it's basically free money.

...However, if you're wrong and something like GME happens......

Let's look at where we are today.

Right now, it's extremely hard to find shares to borrow. This is evidenced by the increase in borrow rate across almost

every broker. Unless you've been hiding under a rock for the past week or so, you've probably seen a few posts talking

about it.

I've been looking at https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME for info on the number of shares available to borrow and the

rate to borrow them. If you've been tracking the Stonk-O-Tracker, you'll see similar reports using IBKR.

The option chain for GME is pretty dramatic this week. If you look at the calls through $140, you'll see what I'm talking
about. Keep in mind this is just for calls expiring on Friday (3/25).

For those who don't know what this picture represents, this is what's called an option chain. You can look this up
on Yahoo. The 3rd column from the left represents the strike price, while the other highlighted columns are option
volume and open interest, respectively*.*

1. When the dollar amount of a stonk rises to the strike price of a call option, the option is considered In The Money
(ITM). Whoever bought the call option can exercise the call and buy the share at the strike price from the seller.

The longer you wait to exercise and the higher the price goes, the deeper ITM the option becomes

2. The number of contracts that are traded- usually daily- is the reported option volume. This is Just like the stonk

volume. There's really nothing complicated here. If you see a high volume for a given option, it means it's highly

liquid and can be traded easily. This number changes often

3. Lastly, the number of ACTIVE options is referred to as the option interest. When looking at the 120 calls in the
screenshot above, there are currently 3,042 active calls (as of 3/23/2022 @ 2:50pm EDT). Each call option
represents 100 shares, so that's a total of 304,200 shares embedded within those options

As you continue on down the line, you can sum the option interest reported at each strike price and then multiply that

total by 100. This gives you the total amount of shares that are eligible to be purchased if the call owners decide to

exercise their rights....

...I started counting calls at the $100 strike because it was the first, big milestone we crossed this week (in terms of
option interest). Since yesterday (3/22), we now have 24,189 call options ITM. That's 2,418,900 shares. This just
represents the calls through the $140 strike, and the options expiring this Friday..

....let that sink in.....

What's most significant here is that the LIKELIHOOD of these options being ITM this week was really, REALLY low. Prior

to yesterday, everything below $100 was considered Out of The Money (OTM). The financial elites and their media

outlets were pushing FUD prior to the earnings report because all of their metrics are based on the most simplistic
numbers like EPS and net income. Any good accountant knows the TRUE details are in the words- not the
numbers. Not one article (that I saw) mentioned any good things about the company, the personnel growth it's had in
the past year, or the transformation that's underway. A lack of "direction" is apparent when executives are milking tendies

off a dying company and refuse to make ANY changes to better that company's future. This is obviously not the case

here and we all know these changes wouldn't be made recklessly. If I was still waiting on GameStop to "be a better brick

and mortar", I would have my doubts. Obviously, that's not true.

Regardless, several investors were expecting a big dip, so placing a bet on calls above $100 was almost a guaranteed

waste of cash...

Now then...

I'll pick back up on options in just a minute but I wanna talk about the events preceding this week. If you've been

watching the borrow rate, you'll realize how much change there's been in the past 10 days or so. You can use a variety

of reports from different brokers, I'm using iborrowdesk.com because it has a decent average and shows time-series

data.

iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

I have no idea what caused the borrow rate to tank after January / February 2021. To this day, it still confuses me. I have

my theory on how HFs are hiding short positions in long-term options (discussed w/ Dr. T and Wes Christian), but have

no idea how, or if, this would affect the borrow rate. If you check the borrow rate against the shares available for borrow,

it doesn't really make sense. The increasing rate from the past couple of weeks doesn't correlate with the reduction in

share availability because we've been at these levels before. I wouldn't be surprised if some back-room deal took place

to reduce the borrow rate long enough for the hedgies to "out-wait" the apes last year, but that's tinfoil and I can't prove

any of it. Besides, we have no idea how many shares were sold naked because no one was paying attention to ANY of

these things in January 2021. I believe that's a different story now. We're watching these things much more closely this

time around.

Anyway, what's important here is the rate IS going up again...

...So why is this significant?..

The borrow rate is one of the biggest indicators of share-scarcity. It comes directly from those lending the shares and

represents some of the best & most timely information we have regarding short selling. Most of the time, we have to

guess at what is going on... we have no idea how many shares are actually available or how quickly they can "smash the

F3 key" (read HOC III) to make it seem like the shares are actually there. However, if you are on the inside of these

operations and actually know the shares are hard to come by, you would naturally start charging higher interest for them.

Let me get to the point.

Let's ignore the fact that you can do all sorts of fancy sh*t with options. All you need to know is that the options

are derived from the underlying asset. In other words, the number of shares that are embedded within the total call

options for a given stock should be less than the total number of shares available to trade in that company. This seems

like common sense because you shouldn't be able to exercise more options than you have shares.

However, we know Wall St. does it because most of the time those options are never exercised. They just pocket the

premiums and laugh all the way to the bank.

That being said, there were over 200m shares dedicated within these options back in January 2021. So when the stonk

started going to the Oort Cloud, there was considerable reason to freak out. The safest thing to do when you sell a call

option is to actually own the share ahead of time. That way if the buyer of that call option decide to exercise the option,

you don't get caught with your pants down... but what are the odds of that actually happening?

Last week, a $150 call wasn't even a reasonable choice... You'd have to pump the stock price 50% in a week to even

consider those being close to ITM. So if I was selling $150 calls on a stock with a "negative outlook" and approaching

earnings season, which is even more likely to report another loss, I wouldn't be worried about covering those calls...

Check this sh*t out.. These are just the $150 calls that expire on 3/25...

Expiring 4/1.....

Expiring 4/8.....

Expiring 4/14.....

Expiring 6/17.....

I'll do the maff for you so you don't blow a gasket...

that's 15,008 call options with a $150 strike price....

.....1,500,800 shares that are dry-humping ITM status.....

..................TODAY.....

Not next week... not next month... TODAY....

Again... I don't know how many of these are covered, but the chances of someone waking up today and having to worry

about it were pretty f*cking slim if you ask me...

So....

Option chain looks juicy, borrow rate going up, share availability low....

What happens if we crack $150? well.. in addition to the previous landslide of shares that are now ITM between $100

and $140, we have over 15,008 more options (1.5m shares) which are more likely to be called sooner than previously

expected..

If I were a SHF and suddenly faced with this harsh reality, I'd be trying to short the absolute f*ck out of it right about now.

The only problem is the availability of shares to borrow is super f*cking low and even if you can FIND them, you have to
pay nearly 10% in interest... Not to mention RETAIL OWNS THE FLOAT THIS TIME AND 25% IS DIRECTLY
REGISTERED WITH THE COMPANY

Just compare that to the 1-2% borrow fee you've been paying for the past 10 months and things are starting to look

pretty sh*tty if you're a SHF. There were literally 0 shares available to borrow yesterday, at least according to the

websites we have. At one point I believe there were less than 5k... which is absolutely dry as a desert.

Now...

So here's the price action today broken down by 15 minute candles.

Pressure to suppress the price below..... what's that?? ....$150 you say?.... Any time the price started to get close, it's
met with immense downward pressure, as evidenced by the red pivot-points...

I'm not one to think that coincidences like this are simply coincidence...

I believe the threat of a gamma squeeze is becoming VERY real and they've got until Friday to release some of that

pressure.. I believe shorts are being very strategic in where and when they load the extra supply to suppress us from

reaching specific price targets. As a short seller, your objective is to sell stock when you think you've reached a high, not

when it's building up to that peak. If there's nothing malicious going on, why not let it run?

I believe the act of RC buying another 100k through the lit exchange, on the ABSOLUTE BEST DAY to do it, dealt a

HUGE blow to the SHF narrative. There couldn't have been a better time to reignite retail investor sentiment.

But hey... what do I know....
