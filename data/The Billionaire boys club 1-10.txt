BBC Part 5

So I spent this morning's pre-market browsing some 13Fs, (This is the way) and I came across a little-known hedge fund

called Sessa Capital.

What stood out to me about this hedge fund, was their huge overweight position of 1.8 million GME puts. (Correction 1.8

million shares of GME Puts estimated at $351 million value)

This is now the fund's biggest position, accounts for 13.5% of their portfolio, and get this... they had not traded Gamestop

prior to Q1 2021.

So I thought to myself... what could have possibly INSPIRED this fund to go all in on a Gamestop short after the Jan

mini-squeeze. Isn't that a bit of a suicide mission? Especially for a fund with such a good track record...

...AND they have not even hedged this position...

So I looked into the fund a little and found it is run by a guy named John Petry.

My immediate thought was... I bet he's connected to Shitadel somehow.

I looked him up on Linkedin... not a past employee.

I checked his Fund's New York Address expecting it to be in the same building as Kenny.

It's not...

But it's not far:

And even closer to Kenny's gaff

(Could easily pop around for a cup of tea)

But realistically... proximity in New York means nothing.

So...

I decided to dig a little deeper.

I discovered that John Petry is on the Board of a company called "Success Academy", which is a New York City Charter

School Network. (Part of the "Billionaire's Boys Club" which is described as a crew of hedge fund managers and

philanthropists who are the angels behind private management charters)

- Reference: https://preaprez.wordpress.com/tag/education-reform-now/

John Petry got on the board by being one of these early Angel Investors in the Carter School. And give a guess who's

name is right there along side his?

Yup...

Mr Kenny "Give me my Tendies" Griffin was also an Angel Investor of $10 million in this charter school.

Reference: https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/philanthropy-magazine/article/the-school-success-sequence

These guys even play Poker together!

Reference: https://www.cdcgamingreports.com/scene-last-night-einhorn-hellmuth-sabat-cornwell-weinstein/

So let's Dig a little deeper...

Reference my Previous Post about Junk Bonds that I couldn't really piece

together: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nyt6l8/wrinkle_brains_needed_citadel_loading_up_on_high/

And a better write up from commenter u/Get-It-Got here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ns7k6q/could_gamestops_liftoff_unravel_corporate_junk/?

utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

So when I was reading up on our new friend (And Kenny's old friend), John Petry, something that stud out to me was

this:

" Petry’s Gotham Capital LLC, founded in 1985 with $7 million from junk-bond king Michael Milken "

Junk Bonds again...

And who was this Junk Bond King, Michael Milken... and how is he connected to all this...

AND OF COURSE... IT'S THIS GUY:

Milken and Griffin Conversation 1:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFeKmMBky40

Milken and Griffin Conversation 2:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iDDDRfZ0I0&ab_channel=CitadelCitadel

Kenny Talking at the Milken Institute again

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IDyyq5Hh2k&ab_channel=MilkenInstituteMilkenInstitute

And I'm sure there's a bunch more out there...

So who the fuck is Michael Milken?

Michael Robert Milken (born July 4, 1946) is an American formerly convicted felon, financier and philanthropist. He is
noted for his role in the development of the market for high-yield bonds ("junk bonds"),[3] and his conviction and
sentence following a guilty plea on felony charges for violating U.S. securities laws.[4] Since his release from prison, he

has also become known for his charitable giving.[5][6] Milken was pardoned by President Donald Trump on February 18,

2020.

Milken was indicted for racketeering and securities fraud in 1989 in an insider trading investigation. As the result
of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to securities and reporting violations but not to racketeering or insider trading. Milken

was sentenced to ten years in prison, fined $600 million, and permanently barred from the securities industry by the

Securities and Exchange Commission. His sentence was later reduced to two years for cooperating with testimony

against his former colleagues and for good behavior.[7] Since his release from prison, Milken has funded medical

research.[8]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So the guy who INVENTED the Junk Bond market, gets banned from ever trading again... and then all of a sudden
becomes best buddies with Kenny G... who trades extensively in Junk Bonds?

And... the same guy funds the company prior to John Petry's current Fund, and the current fund decides to Yolo into

GME shorts AFTER Jan mini squeeze.

And just in case you are thinking this guy would be too afraid to break a lifetime ban?

In February 2013, the SEC announced that they were investigating whether Milken violated his lifetime ban from

the securities industry. The investigation revolved around Milken allegedly providing investment advice through

Guggenheim Partners.[42]

Since 2011, the SEC has been investigating Guggenheim's relationship with Milken.[43]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These guys are all fucking connected!

But of Course... this is just my opinion and I can't prove anything... nor am I a financial advisor.

Edit 1: Sessa Puts Source

Sorry Apes, I don't trade options so my terminology was off. It's 1.8 million shares of GME Puts valued at $351 million.

Not 1.8 million puts

Ok, you apes got me all riled up now after the positive reaction to my last post (Ref Boys Club Part 1) so I've decided to

keep digging.

Let's start with Our New Super Villian Michael "Milky" Milken:

Disclaimer: I'm Irish and have no real interest in American pol itics, so I know once I mention this shit's gonna get

political, but lets try and not...

We're all Apes, we're all here for the Stonk... not for Poli tics.

So... TR UMP pardoned this guy on 18th Feb 2020.

What struck me about this, was that he had 33 people lobbying Tr ump to get his Pardon. (Ref New York Times)

Now, when you click on the link to get the White Houses statement on who these 33 people are, it brings up a 404

error... The statement no longer exists!

But luckily, this Ape has heard of the way back machine!

So using the way back machine, we can get the 33 names. (Ref Wayback Machine)

Dr. Miriam Adelson - Married to Sheldon Adelson

Sheldon Adelson - Tru mps Largest Donor, Casino Tycoon, 28th Richest Person in the world

David Bahnsen - Founder of the Bahnsen Group - Private Wealth Management Firm

Tom Barrack - Founder of REIT company Colony Capital

Maria Bartiromo - Fox News Financial Journalist

Ron Burkle - Founder of The Yucaipa Companies LLC a Private Investment Firm

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao - Politician

William Ford - Seriously? Yes, this is the executive chairman of Ford Motors

Josh Friedman - Screenwriter. Wrote the Terminator Movies. Confirmed Simulation.

Rudy Guiliani - Think we all know Rudy

Josh Harris - Founder of Apollo Global Management - Investment Firm

Rabbi Marvin Hier - Founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center

Ray Irani - CEO of Occidental Petroleum

Robert Kraft - CEO of The Kraft Company

Richard LeFrak - CEO of LeFrak - One of the biggest landlords in New York

Randy Levine - President of the New York Yankees

Howard Lorber - CEO of Vector Group Ltd - A holding Company

Representative Kevin McCarthy - Congressman

Larry Mizel - EC of MDC Holdings (+ Chairman of Simon Wiesenthal Center???)

Arte Moreno - Owner of Anaheim Angels

Rupert Murdoch - Again... Seriously?

Sean Parker - WTF?

John Paulson - Oooh Hedgie #1 - Founded Paulson & Co.

Nelson Peltz - Founder of Trian Fund Management - Investment Firm

Steven Roth - Founder of Vornado Realty Trust - The Largest New York Landlord

David Rubenstein - Yup. CEO of The Carlyle Group

Larry Ruvo - VP of Southern Wine and Spirits of Nevada

Marc Stern - Chairman of the TCW Group - Asset Management Financial Institution.

Steven Tananbaum - Hedgie #2 - Founder of GoldenTree Asset Management

Ted Virtue - CEO of MidOcean (Prior CEO of DB Capital Partners with Oversight of Deutsche Bank)

Andrew von Eschenbach - FDA Commissioner

Mark Weinberger - CEO of EY (Board of Directors at Metlife)

Gary Winnick - Founder of Global Crossing

So fuck me Apes...

This guy has some friend list willing to go to bat for him right?

Can't even count the amount of Billionaires up there and this is just the list of people issued in the official Whitehouse

statement (That mysteriously no longer exists)

So... on with the connections.

Let's cross-reference our hedgies with our favorite stonk.

John Paulson Hedgie #1 - Does not have a position in GME according to latest 13F.

Neither does Hedgie #2, though he does have a small up of a million shares on AMC

How about our investment firms?

Josh Harris at Apollo Global Management decided in Q1 of 2021 that he would trade GME for the first time with a small

put position of 150,000 Shares. (Ref Holdings) - Similar Timing to Sessa Maybe?

But other than that... not a whole load more to report.

How about connections to Kenny Himself?

Well there's a SHITLOAD of that...

Here's just 1 article, referencing 6 of our 33 hitlist in addition to Kenny himself referencing donations to the Repu blican

party. (Again... I'll try keep po litics out of this, but this is establishing connections)

Reference Forbes Article

(Can you spot all 6?)

I'm not going to go through ALL of it as there is WAY too much, but it's safe to say... there are a lot of connections

But here are a few examples to wet your confirmation bias...

Elaine Chao and Kenny hanging out at a Milken event with "The worlds most powerful thinkers"

Kenny, David Rubenstein, Mark Weinberger, Steven Tananbaum all hanging out at the Milken Global Conference in

2017

Kenny buys Rupert Murdochs ex Wife's House

(Can't make this shit up)

+ This Milken Institute seems to be central for a lot of these guys...

ANYWAY....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On to the shit we care about.

We've established that there's a Billionaires Boys Club and Kenny is Part of it.

So let's take the Sessa and Apollo pattern and see if we can expand on it.

What are we looking for?

Companies that own Puts, that first reported ownership in Q1 2021 and that have not hedged.

This gives us this list:

Taconic Capital Advisors: 537,900 shares valued at $102 million

Hound Partners LLC: 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million

CMT Capital Markets Trading: 241,500 shares valued at $45.8 million (Sounds familiar)

Millennium Management LLC: 163,400 shares valued at $31 million

Apollo Management Holdings: 150,000 shares valued at $28.5 million (We know who this is)

CSS LLC: 71,000 Shares valued at $13.5 million

Jefferies Group LLC: 48,000 shares valued at $9 million (Jefferies? WTF)

Ionic Capital Management: 20,600 shares valued at $4million

There's more... but that's enough for now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second biggest NEW put position is Taconic Capital

Founder of Taconic, is Frank Brosens.

Frank Brosens was invited to speak at the Invest for Kids Event in Chicago...

As was Kenny

As was Milken

Reference: Invest for Kids Event Speakers list

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3rd biggest NEW position without a hedge falls to Hound Partners

Couldn't dig up a lot here except this suspiciously convenient article about Kenny having a CURIOUSLY passive stake in

TiVo along with Hound Partners, both in a stock that is "Not exactly widely followed"

https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b150y1tj6mwz2w/citadels-curiously-passive-stake-in-tivo

On the OTHER HAND...

(This shit gets crazy)

Hound Partners was funded by a company called Tiger Management.

Tiger Management was founded by Julian Robertson

And... I really can't believe I am saying this but...

Kenny's Ex-wife, Anne Dias, Managed Money for both Kenny and Julian Robertson!!!!

WTF... THE ACTUAL FUCK

Reference: https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-hedge-fund-veteran-has-contemplated-a-comeback-11559122201

I don't subscribe to WSJ, so only reading the headline... LMFAO

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next up to get knocked down...

Millenium Management Company Run by Israel Englander

Again... a suspiciously convenient example of Citadel and Millennium working in parallel with each other dumping

FireEye Shares.

Reference (Warning... this is a motley fool article. Proceed with Skeptisism. Link)

And yet again... Milken Global Conference 2010 with Milken, Kenny and Englander

https://milkeninstitute.org/article/2010-milken-institute-global-conference-brings-world-leaders-los-angeles-foster-ideas

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apollo we already discussed.

But another cross-referencing showed up this article that has Marc Rowan (Apollo Founder), Kenny AND Julian

Robertson all donating to Mitt Romney

2015: https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/24/milken-time-wall-street-jets-west-for-davos-with-palm-trees.html

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSS LLC was a much tougher nut to crack.

Smaller company. Smaller position.

Finra does have a check on them though (Ref: LINK)

And it shows a single Director: Peter Anthony Ianello

After doing some solid Googling, it turns out he goes by Peter Ianello and is actually the founder of a different company...

OCA Ventures.

I searched them for a 13F, but doesn't exist. (Ref: https://whalewisdom.com/filer/oca-ventures-llc)

But they are out of Chicago and both Kenny and Peter made it to the Chicago 100 list:

http://tullman.blogspot.com/2014/06/who-made-list-techweek-chicago-reveals.html

A cross-reference with Milken shows that both guys are listed as business speakers for events... but that's meh...

That's all I could get for this one... but I am even more suspicious of these smaller funds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ionic Capital Management was a hard nut too

Founders were not listed in Linkedin, but I found an article listing 3 Co-Founders for the company:

Bart Baum

Adam Radosti

Daniel Stone

YET AGAIN... another article talking about Kenny and one of these companies making unusual plays.

Here they talk about Citadel And Ionic (Specifically just these 2) being bullish on a company called Verb. -- ONLY 4

hedge funds in total were trading this company!!!

Ken created the largest position and Ionic had the highest weighting.

And weirdly... in the article... it says both companies had $0 million as their position. lol. WTF.

Reference: https://newsfortomorrow.com/index.php/2019/12/22/hedge-funds-have-never-been-this-bullish-on-verb-

This list goes on... but I think you get the picture...

Been writing and researching this for a good few hours now, so I hope you find some entertainment in it.

I think the point is clear... and something we all knew all along.

There is 100% a Billionaire's Boys Club... but it's still fun to connect some of the dots!

WHO'S ALL IN?

RC Ventures LLC - Good to know the boss is all in! - 9,001,000 Shares - Valued at $159 mil 12.87% Ownership

Hestia Capital Partners LP - This is an interesting little company. 4,726,606 Shares - Valued $89 million - 6.75%
ownership

Founded and run by Kurt Wolf, who was a previous Gamestop Board Member.

His Focus on Deep Value Investing:

The firm focuses on identifying misunderstood companies that are typically generating significant free cash flow. Through

intense research, focused on understanding the competitive dynamics of the industry and their impact on the company’s

prospects, we believe we are able to successfully pick those companies which are simply misunderstood versus truly

broken.

Love it!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We already spoke about the Sessa YOLO, but not to worry... we'll circle back on these puppets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another big mover...

Prelude Capital Management 1.2 million shares of GME PUTS valued at $242 million representing 6% of their portfolio
and their 3rd largest position.

Co-Founded by Gavin Saitowitz and Cisco Del Valle

Gavin

Cisco

So these guys have owned GME previously, but since their last 13F, have increased that position by 1,264,700 shares of

PUTS.

Meaning... that's more than a 10,000% increase in their position.

Remember my first DD that started me down this rabbit hole?

(Check it out here if not)

But that was focused on the junk bonds and particularly $HYG

Well give a guess who else is HEAVY on $HYG PUTS?

Yup... Our boys at Prelude.

Reference: https://whalewisdom.com/filer/springbok-capital-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link

They own 531,000 shares of PUTS in this junk bond worth $46 million and making up 1.19% of their portfolio after

increasing their position by 151%.

ADDITIONALLY...

They own 450,865 shares of the stock itself.

Now you may think this is just a hedge, but they added 419,906 of these shares since their last filing. (An increase of

1,356%)

So what's interesting about this???

Well the top position in these guys portfolio is SPY (PUTS) - 863,100 shares valued at $342,072,000

And... in at 7th position they have QQQ (PUT) at 173,100 shares valued at $55.5 million

So they're betting that the market is going to crash and they are jumping into GME and HYG Puts.

(Funnily enough, Citdel's largest position is also SPY (PUTS) at 6.2% of their portfolio with 63.8million shares valued at

$25 Billion)

Both Companies have hedged against this, but both companies are betting the market is going down and are jumping to

bonds.

So we all know Citadel's relationship with GME, but why if this company knows EVERYTHING that Citadel seems to

know, would they increase their PUTS on GME by 10,000%? UNLESS... they are helping?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And this HYG seems to be the lifeboat Apes. Look at the increase of the BIG BOYS jumping on HYG PUTS:

(See Taconic in there right at the end too?)

Jane Street has HYG in their top 10 after increasing the PUTS by 150%!

(Interestingly Jane Street are decreasing their SPY PUTS and Increasing their SPY CALLS)

- But lets get back on topic.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Who else is jumping on the HYG Bandwagon?

How about Ares Management? A Brand New Position with 2 million shares valued at $174 million and their 4th largest
position?

Ref: https://whalewisdom.com/filer/ares-management-llc#tabholdings_tab_link

How about Jefferies Group? 1,342,700 HYG (PUTS) valued at $117 million and their 13th largest position. (They also
have their top position in SPY(PUTS) - 2,435,608 million shares valued at $965 million. And QQQ(PUT) at 2.3 million

shares valued at $759 million.

Ref: https://whalewisdom.com/filer/jefferies-group-inc-de#tabholdings_tab_link

How about GoldenTree Assets? Buying the underlying stock this time, and actually decreasing it's position but still at
1,150,000 shares valued at $100 million and their 6th largest position. (You may remember these guys from Billionaires

Boys Club Part 2, who also have a large PUT position in AMC)

Ref: https://whalewisdom.com/filer/goldentree-asset-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link

How about Blackstone Group? Brand new position opened up (Late to the party) HYG (PUT) 100,000 shares at $8.7
million value. These guys also have SPY (PUT) at 9,084,800 valued at $3.8 Billion as their 4th largest position. +QQQ

Puts at $2.1 Billion at 5th position

Ref: https://whalewisdom.com/filer/blackstone-group-l-p#tabholdings_tab_link

All of these companies seem to be making SIMILAR moves. Not identical by any means, and I'm sure there are lots of

differences.

But the moves also similar to Citadels Moves.

I mean FFS... They are ALL saying the market is about to CRASH! Including Citadel!

And are we READY FOR THE BOMB DROP?

What do all of these companies have in Common?

They are ALL run by Drexel Burnham Lambert Alumni!!

Yup... He's at the center of it again!

DISCLAIMER: I had to dig deep on this one Apes. Some of the information in this Volume of BBC comes through
unverified sources. I have used source links where possible, but the sources referenced may have their own Agenda in

what they are saying that I can't account for. In saying that... They are mainly referenced to detail my journey, which

leads to verified credible sources.

ALSO... I am not actually going to claim that anyone did anything, merely just connect some dots and let you form your
own opinion.

ALSO... This is not financial advice, I am not financially qualified, and full disclosure I am a $GME shareholder.

ALSO... this post is an introductory post to BBC part 5. I'm working on more connections to $GME, and this is part of
that.

Now that that's out of the way...

Let's dive in. Shits getting Dark Apes. (But no surprises there)

So we all know that Billionaires love to count themselves as Philatropists right?

This is the ONE thing, nearly all of them have in common.

So since I was looking for connections between all these guys for the BBC, I decided to look at what they all had in

common.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not American, so I am not up to date on the School System, but as I'm sure many of you are, I'm guessing you know

a little about Charter Schools?

But again... I'll try to stay out of Pol itics, though a lot of this will hover around the subject.

So on looking into these Billionaires and their Philanthropy... I discovered that ALOT of them were keenly interested in

Charter Schools.

(Don't worry, I will look at the other stuff, but up first is Education)

ANYWAY...

I started down my path for curiosity to see if I could uncover why the Super Rich are so interested in these schools and

"Reforming" education.

I'm sure many of you see this as a worthy endeavor. The school system needs reform as it's severely underfunded right?

Let's start with WHY

My first stop into this DARK CAVE was a little Infographic I found on Facebook... Claiming that the High Cost of

Oaklands Charter Schools were financially impacting the Public School sector by $57 million net loss...

Source: https://www.facebook.com/OaklandEA/photos/a.10150107486279627/10156853628859627/?type=3&theater

Bu this could be explained away and my source can not be verified. So I carried on searching.

NEXT UP

I come across an article discussing Why Billionaires Love Charter Schools

This article goes into detail about the 2 main reasons Billionaires love charters...

TINFOIL HAT TIME

Investing in these schools allows them to 1. Avoid Taxes and 2. Disrupt Unions.

Yup... Anti-Union Conspiracy theory. Maybe it makes sense? I don't know to be honest. (I'll let you make up your own

mind)

But Avoiding Taxes...

Now that's a language I can see the Hedgies speaking.

Source: https://eastbaymajority.com/why-billionaires-love-charter-schools/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I continue down further into the Cave...

It's getting Dark now, and my light is Dim.

I find more and more of these types of articles, hypothesizing different reasons behind the love for Charter Schools...

Some of it may have merit... Some of it may be fluff... I'm not expert.

But I continue to follow the MONEY breadcrumbs.

Before I go there though...

I just wanted to reintroduce our Friend "Milky" Milken

And another SUPERSTONK favorite...

Yep... Mr Bill gates... NOW... DISCLAIMER... I'm a nerd and love computers and have looked up to old Billy since I was

a kid. I honestly respect him until proven otherwise.

But he does come into play here.

I was looking into WHO actually invests in these Charter Schools and I came across this article...

GOT DOUGH? HOW BILLIONAIRES RULE OUR SCHOOLS.

Now this article is in a pretty reputable Magazine, with high domain authority, readership and traffic.

(BUT AGAIN... I have not verified this magazines Agenda)

The article details the ongoing campaigns of Billionaires to pump 100s of millions into these schools.

The 3 BIGGEST of these are:

The Bill and Linda Gates Foundation

The Broad Foundation

The Walton Family Foundation

We will get into this in more detail shortly... BUT... BOMB DROP TIME...

(A bigger bomb is coming)

Give a guess who else was listed in this article?

FUCKING MILKEN... They didn't even call him by his full name and listed him in a bunch of other names... so much so

that if you were skimming the article and not paying attention... you would have missed it.

"And they fund the same vehicles to achieve their goals: charter schools, high-stakes standardized testing for students,

merit pay for teachers whose students improve their test scores, firing teachers and closing schools when scores don’t

rise adequately, and longitudinal data collection on the performance of every student and teacher. Other foundations—
Ford, Hewlett, Annenberg, Milken*, to name just a few—often join in funding one project or another"*

So DOT CONNECTED... we now have a common interest between Milken and Gates.

(The common Interest between Gates and Kenny... is ALOT more substantial)

NOW... LET'S GET INTO HOW INTERESTED THESE GUYS ARE IN CHARTERS

Milken:

Damming Article about Milken and FOR PROFIT Cyber schools from 2013:

https://www.prwatch.org/news/2013/10/12257/junk-bonds-junk-schools-cyber-schools-fleece-taxpayers-phantom-

students-and-faili

(Early Days, before they worked out the kinks)

Article in Bloomberg (Which I refuse to pay for) stating:

The children attend Agora Cyber Charter School, managed by K12 (LRN), the largest U.S. operator of taxpayer-

funded online schools and part-owned by billionaire Michael Milken.

And goes to say:

If it were a school district, it would be one of the largest in America. K12 expects to generate $500 million in

revenue this year—it earned a $21.5 million profit last year—and its stock has doubled in value since the

company went public in December 2007. The financial success of K12 has shown that Milken—the 1980s junk-

bond king, convicted felon (securities fraud), and health-care philanthropist—has figured out how to profit from

public schools.

Hang on 1 second now!

This article is saying that Michael Milken, the 1980's junk-bond king, convicted felon (securities fraud), and health-care
philanthropist... HAS FIGURED OUT A WAY TO PROFIT FROM TAX-FUNDED PUBLIC SCHOOLS?

...fuck me...

Again, I'll let you make your own determination on this... but this seems to tie back into all the Tin Foil hat articles I've
been reading today...

I think you get the Point Apes Right?

This is NOT an exhaustive list. They are ALL at it. THE LIST GOES ON.

And RIGHT NOW... I am only looking at education.

Not AMIND the fucking donations to political parties (On both sides) that support charter schools.

So WHY are they doing it?

Is it to crush the Unions?

Is it to avoid taxes?

Is it Politics related?

Is it OUT OF THE GOODWILL OF THEIR HEARTS???

Is it a combination of everything?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point in my journey down this dark, never-ending cave of Doom and Eternity!!!

I think back to our friend... MIKEY "MILKY" MILKEN

(Image added, because I know you guys love them)

Didn't that 1 article say he FOUND A WAY TO PROFIT FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS????

(ARE YOU READY FOR THAT BOMB I PROMISED?)

I started digging...

That's when I came across an article in Forbes on THIS VERY TOPIC...

An article with Credible sources, an actual research paper... and what MAY BE THE TRUTH.

(Up to you to decide)

IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROFIT, EVEN FROM A NON-PROFIT, CHARTER SCHOOL

Of course it fucking is...

The rich know how to get richer. That's a language they speak.

And it's even better, when the methods grant you perks, like Tax Haven's and public perception.

WONDERING HOW BILLIONAIRES MAKE MONEY FROM CHARTER SCHOOLS?

This research on Colorado.edu, highlights 4 major concerns.

1. A substantial share of public expenditure intended for the delivery of direct educational services to children is being

extracted inadvertently or intentionally for personal or business financial gain, creating substantial inefficiencies;

2. Public assets are being unnecessarily transferred to private hands, at public expense, risking the future provision of

“public” education;

3. Charter school operators are growing highly endogenous, self-serving private entities built on funds derived from

lucrative management fees and rent extraction which further compromise the future provision of “public” education;

and

4. Current disclosure requirements make it unlikely that any related legal violations, ethical concerns, or merely bad

policies and practices are not realized until clever investigative reporting, whistleblowers or litigation brings them to

light.

SOURCE: https://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/charter-revenue

-- I haven't gone through it all, as it's 56 pages long and I have other fish to fry, but it seems legit. IMO.

The Forbes article is a great read and I recommend everyone do so:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2018/08/13/how-to-profit-from-your-non-profit-charter-school/?

sh=6f7583ac3354

The sources on here are great rabbit holes too.

The main methods listed here to profit from these schools are Real Estate and Management Companies.

Furthering this is an article in the WALL STREET JOURNAL about Real Estate Businesses investing HEAVILY in

Charter schools.

If there were no financial benefits... how would this make sense?

And...

Here's another article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette talking about how Charter Schools are pulling money from the

Public School System and being paid to Charter School Landlords

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apes there's tons of this...

SEAS of information about the top 1% pumping money into Charters

This is just the TIP OF THE ICE-BERG

But back to the main focus of this post.

This is further evidence of the Billionaires Boys Club...

What you believe in turns of the reason for this, is completely up to you...

But it is Public Information about how much focus these schools are getting from people at that top and they are all

connected in some shape or form...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If they all collaborate on Philantrapy this much when it's theoretically legal... how close are they communicating about

things they are NOT ALLOWED TO?

DISCLAIMER:

Again... this post is just about me researching the reasons behind certain questions and documenting the public

information available to me on these topics.

No claims are made against anyone referred to in this article and anyone passing judgment on this is doing so of their

own opinion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok Apes... Last time we spoke, we talked about Charter Schools and questioned the reason why SO MANY Billionaires

we're interested in investing in them.

I'll let you make your own interpretations: PART 4

This time... we are going to talk about the OTHER thing that Billionaires all love to pump money into...

FOUNDATIONS

Now... don't get me wrong here. I'm sure there are lots of foundations out there that do a lot of good. This is merely an

examination of the FUNCTIONALITY of these foundations and why they potentially get so much attention from the

super-rich.

Let's start with one we all know...

The Bill and Linda Gates Foundation

Now... maybe you already know this, maybe you don't... but Non-Profit Foundations get significant tax breaks from the

government... but they still need to report to the IRS through what's called a FORM 990.

So I decided to look at The Bill and Linda Gates Foundations FORM 990.

Specifically, their last filled one which was sent in 2020, for year 2019.

So let's take a look-see...

The Gates Foundation:

Received $3.3 BILLION in Contributions (Makes sense so far)

Earned $826 million from Dividends and Interest from Securities (Wait WHAT?)

The Gates foundation is trading securities?

Am I the only person who didn't know this?

Gross Sales of all assets of $260 BILLION

Net Profit from Sales of Assets of $2 Billion

Capital Gains Net Income $6 Billion

Net Revenue $6.4 Billion

Net Investment Income $7 Billion

And then what are their expense?

THE BIGGEST ONE...

Total contributions paid: $5.8 Billion

Meaning...

Their NET INCOME was just $320 million

But their NET INVESTMENT income is $6.9 BILLION?

So they take money in... invest it... pay it back out... but keep the investment profits?

+ They don't have to pay capital gains tax as it's a charitable foundation.

+ Total Tax Paid on their investment side was $25.6 Million of $7 Billion in Profits!!

+ That's a 0.3% tax rate!

But this COULD be just speculating on high-level numbers right?

NAH...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They actually break it down for us...

Investments in Government Obligations: $8.9 BILLION

Investment in Corporate Stocks: $33.5 BILLION

Investment "Other" (WTF?): $5.8 Billion

TOTAL ASSETS $50 BILLION

(That's more than Citadel has AUM)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And they ACTUALLY list this...

Net Value of NONCHARITABLE-USE ASSETS for 2019? $47.6 BILLION

So MOST of their assets are not actually for Charitable use???

Fuck me...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How much investment has gone into the Gates Foundation?

Mr William H Gates? Management Fees $64 million

Mr William H Gates? Securities $452 million

Mr William H Gates? $55 Million

Mr William H Gates and Melinda French Gates? $10.8 million

Mr Warren Buffett? $2.7 BILLION

Non-Cash Property Given? Class B Berkshire Hathaway Shares valued at… $2.7 BILLION

So really… Warren just put in $2.7 Billion of Shares as Assets on their books? I wonder why… ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What CONTROLLED ENTITIES have they Contributed to?

The Global Good Fund $100 Million

GreenBriar Equity Fund $6 Million

(These are the only ones they are obliged to document)

Contributions from CONTROLLED ENTITIES?

GreenBriar Equity Fund? $174 million

Hang on… lol. Did they just report that they gave GreenBriar $6 million and GreenBriar gave them back $174 million?

Nice returns.. lol

Lol… I’m not wrinkled brained enough to know what that means really… but lol.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've taken on board the feedback that my last BBC was a little depressing... SO

Here's a puppy Break to cheer you up...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They EVEN LIST THE STOCKS that they are invested in…

(Gamestop is not one)

But look who has got $11.3 Billion? Berkshire Hathaway

(Remember Warren only invested $2.7 Billion)

Disclaimer: I fucking love the shit outta Warren Buffett

Other big numbers:

$1.5 Billion in Canadian Natl Railway

$1.6 Billion in Caterpillar

$1.3 Billion in Walmart

$2.2 Billion in Waste Management Inc

What do these stocks have in Common? They are NOT Berkshire Hathaway stocks… because that would be WAY to

obvious. But LOOK like they are nice safe, solid, FUNDAMENTALLY sound positions. I’ll say no more.

They list their Corporate Bonds too, but nothing stood out to me. Feel free to take a comb through

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENTS OTHER

This is an interesting little section in the Form 990.

They actually break down their other investments, which if you remember was listed as a total of $5.8 billion.

Some wrinkle brains should def go through this, as I have no clue what I am looking at, but here are a few points that

stood out to me:

Citadel is listed on there as a Bank Loan, but for only $1.5 million. Breadcrumbs...

Bridgewater Pure Alpha Lead was given $87 million listed as a partner? Interesting…

Canada Housing Trust was given $752 million as a Foreign Government Issue

China Government Bond and Treasuring were given $750 million, listed as Foreign Government Issues

100s of Millions went to different pools that I don’t understand

700 million went into buying PHYSICAL Gold Bars -- WTF Bill? Lol

$223 million went to GreenBriar as a partnership? (Remember GreenBriar were the ones that donated $174

million earlier)

100 million went to GTI 8 Institutional Investors (Whoever they are)

$805 Million went to Mexico CETES what ever that is?

I think you get the picture right?

NOW….

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a couple of sections in this document that for some stupid reason are printed SIDEWAYS…

(Maybe they want these to be more difficult to read?)

But I did read one of them…

This is TITLED:

Net Gain or LOSS from Sale of Assets not on Line 10

Ok, so first up wtf with this as a title?

Is this additional revenue that they just don’t have to list at all?

How it’s required is just listed as purchased or donated

Date Acquired is just listed as VARIOUS

Date Sold is just listed as VARIOUS

But… remember that number I threw out right AT THE START OF THIS POST???

(Go on… check… I’ll wait - See if you can figure out which number I am referring to?)

I said…

Listed as having GROSS SALES OF GROSS SALES PRICE OF ALL ASSETS?

That number was $260 BILLION…

Take that in for a second…

The total AUM of Citadel is $35 Billion

$260 Billion is 7 times that size!!

(I did the math)

Well that $260 BILLION is also listed on one of these SIDEWAYS PAGES that they don’t want us to read… under Net

Gain from Sale of Assets Not on Line 10???

They even break this down for us! (On a SIDEWAYS PAGE of course)

The big numbers… (The ones in the billions) are:

$11 Billion in Equities

$87 Billion in Fixed Income (How is this amount a fixed income)

$162 Billion in Cash Equivalents

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?

AND THAT”S THE END OF THE REPORT!

SOURCE: https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/911663695_201912_990PF_2021021717709925.pdf

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So it’s safe to say… that JUST LIKE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS, these foundations are all REALLY in the business of
making money right? - Just MY OPINION of course…

But let’s check if the pattern holds true…

I tried looking up different foundations… and lot’s of the WELL KNOWN foundations, I couldn’t find ANY Form 990s on.

(Sometimes these foundations are known by one name, but listed as a different name)

But here’s the ones that I have and show a similar pattern:

Example: The Lynn & Stacy Schusterman Foundation is ACTUALLY listed as Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family
Foundation

(Charles is the Father, who was an oil Tycoon)

Donations: $5.7 million

Dividends and Interest: $34 million (They invest both directly in companies and through Stocks)

Net Gain from Sale of Assets: $151 million

Total Revenue $207 million

Net Investment Income $197 million

Total Assets: $2.2 BILLION

Reference: https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/731312965_201912_990PF_2021021317706329.pdf

-- IMPORTANTLY HERE… this example lists their PAYEES. Alot of which are foundations themselves.

Want MORE examples?

Charles Koch - Koch Industries

The Charles Koch Foundation (Christ, they all name them the same)

Donations: $128 Million

Dividends $15 million

Revenue $168 Million

Investment Income $39 million

“Other” Investments Balance $617 million

Total Assets: $685 million

What are the “Other” investment?

Elliot International Fund $50 mil

EFPRP (What ever the fuck this is) $535 million

BAIH (What ever the fuck this is) $60 million

Source: https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/480918408_201812_990PF_2020012117047703.pdf

I’m not going to go through ALL of these foundations, because 1… they are hard to track down due to naming

variations… 2… My Head hurts from reading this shit and being shocked.
But I think it’s safe to say that it most CERTAINLY is possible that other foundations are doing similar right?

So let me get this straight…

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rich People, Create Foundations to avoid tax, take in donations, Invest the donations, make profit from the investments,

and then donate the incoming donations out to Charter Schools (Which Make them profit), Political Campaigns (Which

Gain them influence) or other Foundations (Which likely do the same kind of shit)... and maybe help some people along

the way too for some good PR?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is this the world we’re living in?

Who else has a foundation?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But first... PUPPY BREAK!

Aww... look it that little cute smile on him!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund - Couldn’t find anything on this… (I Checked all variations I could think of)

The Citadel Foundation - There is money going through here, but not being invested

Source: https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/364482467_201812_990PF_2019032916200160.pdf

(Lots of Educational Donations though)

Michael “Milky” Milken… you can bet he’s got some.

The Milken Family Foundation $100 million in assets and you can bet he’s trading through here too… (Lots going
through Apollo)

https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/954073646_201911_990PF_2021040817913329.pdf

But of Course…

He’s got the Milken Institute aswell…

$500 million in assets

He’s trading Securities through it, with Gross sales of $37 million, and $230 million directly invested in securities,

He donates through it (Lots of Educational),

Source: https://apps.irs.gov/pub/epostcard/cor/954240775_201912_990_2021040217865675.pdf

The List Goes on Apes I’m Afraid…

So I’ll be brief with these:

George Soros Has the Open Society Foundations

Charles Feeney has a foundation

Intels Gordon Moore has a foundation

The Broad Family has a foundation

Renaissance Hedge Fund Manager Jim Simons has 1

Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan have 1

Michael & Susan Dell have 1

Leonard & Ronald Lauder have 1

Oil and Banking George Kaiser has 1

Hedgie Julian Robertson (You remember him right?) has 1

(Yup… I checked, it follows the pattern)

Ted Turner Founder of CNN has one called the United Nations Foundation - And he’s trading securities through it!

(The UN can not raise funds itself)

The list goes on Apes…

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AM I SAYING THAT ALL FOUNDATIONS DO THIS?

Most certainly not.

AM I SAYING THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FOUNDATIONS ARE USED FOR PROFIT THROUGH INVESTING AND

TRADING SECURITIES?

Most Certainly - In my opinion at least and from what I can see in these Form 990s

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well that's it for today Apes...

I hope this doesn't slant your view of humanity!

Remember, there are lots of beautiful things out there including this community and each one of you GLORIUS

BASTARDS!

Sorry for the delay with this one Apes. IRL gets in the way sometimes.

This one has been a bit of a journey too. I don't have all the answers here, so again... I leave it to you to make your own

interpretations... THIS IS MERELY A DISCOVERY JOURNEY OF PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

SMILE FOR THE CAMERA KENNY

So today's episode of BBC is going to start out at the public-facing image they want you to look at. For Kenny and his

Wife at the time, that comes in form of the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation.

(They like this format: Bill and Linda Gates Foundation)

The headline for the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation is:

The Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation believes that powerful ideas change the world. We identify and

support pioneering leaders whose visionary ideas introduce new thinking and drive results. We focus on

education, healthcare and the arts because these pursuits form the core of a vibrant, creative, and productive

society.

And the Fact they have PLEDGED $100 million to charitable and philanthropic causes since 2009

This is their tagline in the media. Source: https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/kenneth-and-anne-griffin-foundation-

likely-to-close-due-to-divorce

SO I DECIDED TO FACT CHECK THIS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIRST OFF - Let's address the fact that these numbers are all pledged!

When you hear about X Billionaire donating to X cause, from what I can tell... this is usually in the form of a pledge, not a
donation. So they get the headlines for setting up a Direct Debit to these causes so to speak... 10 million, might be 1
million a year for 10 years.

SECOND OFF - Take note of the year... $100 million since 2009

I decided to WAYBACK MACHINE this shit, and found the website:

Ok... so they do claim $100 million in pledges on their website, but... they claim since 1999.

(10 years earlier than what the media reports)
SO....

The foundation officially announced it would shut down in 2014.

So if you were to go with what the website claims, the foundation ran from 1999 - 2014.

(Let's do some math)

That's 15 years!

OR... if you were to go by what the media claims or Wikipedia states, the foundation ran from 2009 - 2014....

(Math pause...)

That's 5 years!
BUT... when we look at the IRS Form 990s... (Which you can freely search here) it will only show the company final

letters (Which you would think are a confirmation of them disbanding, but is actually their confirmation of tax-exempt

status)

-- There were actually 2 of these listings for Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation with the same Final letters.

-- BUT... I found out this was the normal process for the IRS. They no longer make public the records for charitable

organizations that have shut down...

CONVENIENT...

Luckily... after a bit of Google Detectiving, I found a website that archives at least SOME of these old tax-exempt

organizations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But before we jump into the nitty-gritty... let's take a quick pause to appreciate some puppy pics...

Aww.... who's a good little boy??? Yes! You're a good little boy!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE KENNETH AND ANNE GRIFFIN FOUNDATION - FORM 990S.

2014: https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/364747915/2014_12_PF%2F36-4747915_990PF_201410

Listed as $1.7 million donated

Listed as $0 approved for future payment

Sideways Reading - (These pages are always sideways on the IRS website for some reason...)

$1.6 million paid to

Breast Cancer Research Foundation: $10k

Chicago Council on Global Affairs: $25k

Children’s Hospital of Chicago Foundation: $550k

Robin Hood Foundation: $1 million

Rush Mother’s Milk Club: $5k

Usher III Initiative: $50k

In this Filing… as of Oct 1, 2014 both Ken and Anne signed a statement saying that they have $650k of funds
remaining in the foundation and a remaining commitment of $2 million to Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago

Remaining funds and outside funds will pay this off.

Foundation will be liquidated and dissolved

(Also in here… is that final letter confirming Dissolution that should prob be on the IRS website? But maybe I’m wrong.)

2013:

$6.9 million in contributions (All Kens Contributions)

Contributions out $5.1 million

Excess of Revenue $1.7 million which carried forward

Donated to:

Children’s Hospital of Chicago: $4 million

Rush Mothers Milk Club: $55k

Weill Cornell Medical College: $833k

2012:

Only $1 of revenue went through the foundation

Source: HERE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wait what???

Didn't our earlier math tell us that they had somewhere 15 and 5 years depending on what source you referenced?

SO WHY THE FUCK IS THERE ONLY 2 YEARS OF FORM 990s? - 1 OF WHICH IS THE COMPANY WINDING

DOWN?

And let's do a LITTLE BIT MORE MATH...

According to the foundation's Form 990 the total ACTUALLY paid out was:

2014: $1,642,788

2013: $4,888,334

So that’s a total of… (Hang on let me fetch my calculator)...

$6,531,122

And let’s not forget… the outstanding balance of $2 million to the Chicago Children’s hospital

So…

$8,531,122

BUT… the donation to the Children’s hospital ALONE was supposed to be $16 million announced in 2010 --- BY THE

FOUNDATION… which hadn’t even been setup yet.

So let me see…

$100 million - $8,531,122 = $91,468,878

Hey Kenny? I think we may have a problem here…

And further down the rabbit hole we go...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUT... before we do... let's take a moment. A puppy Moment!

SMILE FOR THE CAMERA! No look over here... over here good boy... fuck it, just take it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So after a little digging on this curiosity string, I remembered an Article stating that the foundations commitments would
be taken on by the Citadel Foundation.

Source: https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-griffin-foundation-0906-biz-20140906-story.html

So let's take a look at that...

(Yup, Citadel have their own Foundation)

But there ain't a whole load going on here...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first Form 990 for the Citadel Foundation appears in 2016 (Bit of a gap in the records there)

This shows a mere 90k of donations in…

And a Total of $461,484 in donations out to:

Latin School Chicago

Council For Economic Education

Muscular Dystrophy Association

Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation

Hartford Hospital

Leadership Greater Chicago

University of Chicago Lab Schools

Francis W Parker School

Merit School of Music

Jewish United Fund

Hedge Funds Care

Jewish Enrichment Center

WITS

All Stars Helping Kids

Thresholds Phychiatric Rehabilition Center

St Jude Childrens Research Hospital

Autisism Science Foundation

No mention of the Chicago Childrens Hospital

THE KENNETH C. GRIFFIN CHARITABLE FUND

The story continues...

I found MANY references to Kenny boy making donations to various causes, under ever increasing amounts, referencing

The Kenneth C. Griffing Charitable Fund.

(Here's a couple)

On Citadels OWN WEBSITE:

intends-to-make-a/1333523493442956/

On Citadels Twitter account:

But GUESS WHAT...

Search for Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund on the IRS website. <<HERE>>

GO ON... I DARE YOU!!!

I DOUBLE DARE YOU!!!

You WILL NOT FIND IT!

I tried every variation of the name of this fund but I can't find anything!

This sent me on a LONG SEARCH APES...

This search almost had me at breaking point.

I had almost given up... and was about to post this post as is...

When it hit me!

Can you guess what it was>?>?

I have mentioned it in this DD... and trust me when I say this... it was hidden as 1 sentence in the mass of notes I've

taken while researching this.

I almost missed it.

WHILE I WAIT TO SEE IF YOU APES CAN FIGURE OUT THE KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PUPPY BREAK!

Who's got my finger... is it a WOLF... no! It's only this cute little monster!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok did you get it?

-- There were actually 2 of these listings for Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation with the same Final letters.

There were 2 SEPERATE ENTITIES - listed under the name Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation in the Form 990s...

How is it possible to have 2 separate companies, using the same name... collecting tax-exempt status?

WELL... APES... LET ME TELL YOU...

I decided to do a fancy google search for the EIN number (Unique identifier) for each of these companies... and I

stumbled across another archive database.

This archive has a lot less information it would seem...

But it does have this...

2011 - Form 990 - COMPANY: The Blue Knight Foundation

2012 - Form 990 - COMPANY: The Blue Knight Foundation

And if you check these out... you'll notice in the company name field, you'll see:

THE BLUE KNIGHT FOUNDATION AKA THE KENNETH AND ANNE GRIFFIN FOUNDATION

So Kenny tends to name his charities one thing and tell the media that's it's through an Alias name?

Why the fuck would you want to do that?

So if he's willing to do that once... could he be doing it again with the Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund?

Is there a fund out there that Kenny is managing, that like we previously showed... has the potential to be a whale in the

stock market?

Why did the Kenneth and Anne Griffin Foundation, claim to PLEDGE $100 million since 1999, tell the media it was

actually founded in 2009... and yet actually only have records under that name from 2013 and 2014...???

Why does this article talk about:

In October 2006, the Griffins together with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation founded a new charter school

in Chicago named the Woodlawn High School. Griffin’s charitable foundation

????????????????????????????

So many more questions Apes... so little time...

Stay tuned for the NEXT EPISODE of the BBC!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PS... I've noticed that I have started to be referred as the BBC guy... is there any way I can get the community to

reconsider this... (Pfftt ha haa ha)

First off Apes, apologies it's taken so long to get to episode 7.

Sometimes an Ape actually has to work, and can merely pump out Head Banging Beavis and Butthead memes instead

of spending hours a day scrolling through Tax Forms.

Plus... those memes are fun... this... not so much...

But HERE WE GO AGAIN...

Jeff Bezos, 1 Man alone, is worth more than 270 million people COMBINED across these countries. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today's episode is brought to you by the letter D...

What is a Donar Advised Fund? (DAF)

A DAF is a giving account established at a public charity. It allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an

immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants from the fund over time.

Source

Sounds positive right? Like a charity right?

But there are a couple of subtle differences here...

FIRST... let's just get this one out of the way...

There are NO REQUIREMENTS for a DAF to actually donate ANY portion of their fund to a charitable organization...

Seriously...

That example I was talking about...

In 2014, the founder and CEO of Go Pro, Nicholas Woodman took his company public.

This earned him a HARD-EARNED $3 Billion...

Now don't get me wrong... I'm not ANTI-Capitalism...

Sure some shit is crazy like Bezos...

But Woodman... then had a tax bill on his $3 Billion of around 15% meaning he owed the Government $450 million.

GREAT you might think...

That can go back into society...

Pay for some homeless shelters...

Build better roads...

SOMETHING...

NAH...

What did he do?

He setup a DAF... Donated $500 million to it and PUFF

That tax bill was GONE

FUCKING GONE!!!

Source

But you may be thinking... ok, so he created a DAF, he donated $500 million, at least that will go to some good causes?

Even if there is no REQUIREMENT to donate anything to a charitable cause... surely SOMEONE is looking under the

hood to make sure nothing shady is going on right?

Well 4 years later... the New York Times decided to take a look...

See how this $500 million was doing good in the world...

By then... The ONLY donation Woodman had made was an undisclosed sum to a fundraiser called "The Bonny Doon
Art, Wine, and Brew Festival"

Source (requires NYtimes subscription which I refuse to pay)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you see...

Not only does a DAF NOT have any requirements to donate to charitable causes... they have very little requirements at

ALL...

You don't have to donate to anything...

You get an IMMEDIATE tax write-off...

You can use the fund to INVEST in WHATEVER you want...

You can transfer Money, Stocks, Land, Cars, Art... anything that you MIGHT not want to pay tax on

You can HIRE YOUR BUDDIES to work for your DAF under undisclosed positions

You can setup your DAF to provide Salaries for GENERATIONS of your family name

And not only that...

BUT...

It is also possible for you to open a donor-advised fund as a complement and a companion to your existing 

private foundation, maximizing your tax benefits while achieving your philanthropic goals.

Now fuck me... that sounds suspect as fuck...

Veins are popping out of my head right now... so you know what time it is!!! 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awww... look at that puppy in a cup...

Aren't you the Cutest Puppy in a cup I've Ever Seen?

Yes you are... Yes you Are...

So anyway... DAFs...

I looked up the definition of a DAF on the IRS website... and even they say there's some shady shit going down here... 

The Definition starts out pretty normal with this:

Generally, a donor advised fund is a separately identified fund or account that is maintained and operated by a section

501(c)(3) organization, which is called a sponsoring organization. Each account is composed of contributions made by

individual donors. Once the donor makes the contribution, the organization has legal control over it. However, the donor,

or the donor's representative, retains advisory privileges with respect to the distribution of funds and the investment of

assets in the account.

Then IMMEDIATELY... next paragraph... says this:

The IRS is aware of a number of organizations that appeared to have abused the basic concepts underlying

donor-advised funds. These organizations, promoted as donor-advised funds, appear to be established for the

purpose of generating questionable charitable deductions, and providing impermissible economic benefits to

donors and their families (including tax-sheltered investment income for the donors) and management fees for

promoters.

A NUMBER of organizations... dodging taxes with these things.

Have you Apes heard anything about this?

There must be some serious investigations going on right?

MEH...

Not really.

I mean there is definitely some dodgy stuff going through these things...

America’s Biggest (Edit: Religion) Charity Funnels Tens of Millions to (Edit:
Questionable) Groups Through DAFS:

https://readsludge.com/2019/03/19/americas-biggest-christian-charity-funnels-tens-of-millions-to-hate-groups/

The President of the New York Legal Assistance Group, diverts $2.3 million
to DAFs, Makes $1.7 million through them, then transfers that $1.7 million
back to the New York Legal Assistance group and when he's caught, gets
fined $150,000...

(Can't Make this shit up)

https://www.thenonprofittimes.com/npt_articles/deal-stuck-donor-advised-fund-scam/

But REALISTICALLY... there ain't much here at all.

But LET ME ASK YOU THIS APE...

Do YOU (Yes You) think that the 1%ers of this world, when offered all these BENEFITS while at the same time 
completely wiping out their Tax Bill... AND... Ensuring their heir line in perpetuity... that they wouldn't be taking advantage 

of it?

Pushing the limit of morals so to speak?

--- LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMENTS? 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So of course... you'd think this GET OUT OF TAX FREE card would be popular right?

Let's take a look...

Seems like they are giving more and more... ok CHECK

But get this...

We know these guys all have their own charities right?

Well in 2019, grants of $25 BILLION were given from DAFS to Charities... (hmm... I wonder if they give to their OWN

charities through DAFs?) - This represents a 93% increase since 2015...

And of course... in 2019 $38.81 Billion was donated INTO DAFs... again and 80% increase since 2015!

So these things are INCREASING RAPIDLY in popularity!

-- And guess what?

THIS IS JUST THE DAFS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHARITIES!

So if I am a Billionaire and I own a charity... I likely own a DAF too...

53 National Charities have a DAF

607 Community Foundations have a DAF

333 Single Issue Charities have a DAF

But what about Private Foundations... Like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation... or the Kenneth C Griffin Charitable 

Foundation that doesn't seem to exist???

THERE ARE 873,228 DAFS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIVATE 
FOUNDATIONS IN THE US ALONE

Source

NOW...

When you look at this report, there are some metrics in there that make this seem like it's not such a big deal like this 

one...

So the average payout from these DAFs is 22.4%... so at least they are doing something right?

But what you may not notice... is that none of the data in this report are on DAFs associated with Private Foundations!!!

WHY???

BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPORT ANYTHING TO ANYONE

Urrrghhh....

Also, these funds can be relatively anonymous because, unlike foundations, they are not required to disclose as

much information about their charitable giving. This means that finding detailed, public information about a
donor-advised fund's grantmaking activities can be challenging for grantseekers and researchers***.***

Source

So basically... ANYONE can set one of these up... and can be basically ANONYMOUS... Especially if you already have a

Private Foundation Charity!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's when it HIT ME Apes...

The Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund...

It's a FUCKING DAF!!!

THAT'S why I couldn't find any record of it...

THAT'S why his charitable donations numbers were all over the place...

So I did a little digging...

And I found it...

He left ONE TRACE

You need to SIGN UP to get access to this one, which I am normally against... but at least it's free...

THE SMOKING GUN

Quote:

Griffin founded the Citadel Investment Group, a hedge fund in Chicago. He is a prolific donor who primarily gives
through his donor-advised fund, the Kenneth C. Griffin Charitable Fund, and mostly supports universities and arts and
culture institutions. His biggest gifts are $150 million to Harvard in 2014, $125 million to the University of Chicago in

2017, and $125 million to the Museum of Science and Industry in 2019.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So there you have it Apes...

You now know, Kenny has his own get out of Tax Free Card with 0 regulation and has set himself up to protect

his family line in perpetuity, and when MOASS happens and Citadel goes down... Kenny Declares Bankruptcy...

he can still give himself a new job with a 7 or 8 figure Salary while trading the market as he pleases...

THROUGH HIS FUCKING DAF

That's it for this leg of the investigation...

BUT IT WILL CONTINUE!!!

Ok Apes... I think we've done enough prep work to start talking about the bigger picture stuff.

So far we've covered:

The Milken Institute

The Connections between all the big boys

The Big GME Short Positions

Bill Gates

Charter Schools

Private Foundations

A look behind the scenes with Kenny

DAFs

By no means is this list exhaustive... but it's definitely enough to start thinking about some things...

So let's start with WHY...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do these guys all have charities?

Why do the charities all have DAFs?

Why does the divide between rich and poor get greater and greater?

Why does the world around you always seem just a little bit off?

(Are we REALLY in the Matrix?)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This episode... I'm going to talk about a Hypothetical...

Let's pretend for a minute that I BADASSTRADER am a 37 year old genius trader that wants to run the worlds
BIGGEST and BEST hedge fund?

I've been trading since my college days at Harvard and have spent my time building all the right connections.

By 2006, I have a personal net worth of $1.7 Billion... by 2007, I've nearly doubled that PERSONAL net worth to $3

Billion and my Company Gets Rated the Best Hedge Fund by EuroMoney in 2007 with AUM of $16 Billion...

So I'm starting to hit my goals... voted the BEST Hedge Fund... but not yet the BIGGEST... and of course then along
comes 2008.

This REALLY scares the SHIT out of me...

I have to fight and fight and fight just to survive 1 more day, and though I barely scrape through, it has never hit home

how quickly and easily everything I've built comes crashing down.

So I need to start getting smarter.

In 2008, I lost $8 billion of my clients money...

I jumped on a conference call with my Clients, reassured them of my company's stability with an $8 billion line of credit

from banks... and then I froze all their accounts from withdrawals.

I deleveraged most of my higher-risk strategies and focused instead on my multistrategy funds. By Jan, I was back to

making profits (Well before the bottom of the crash)

By November... I'm back up by 59%, I have $13 Billion AUM and I'm smart enough to know there is a void in the market

by the collapse of Lehman Brothers...

I send my right-hand man Rohit D'Souza to New York and setup Citadel Securities to take advantage of this void.

Now I am trading High-Yield Dept for Institutional Clients, I am underwriting Bonds and I am offering Loan Deals in the

100s of millions.

Normally... It takes New Securities Firms 3 years just to reach breakeven...

I do it in 12 months by launching Citadel Execution Services, which becomes the largest equity options market maker in

the US in a matter of weeks and now my fund has $25 Billion AUM.

Source

I now feel unstoppable... I am smarter than everyone else and I have done what nobody thought possible

So what do I do now? I need to lock this in and protect my downside right?

I had already setup my DAF but now that I am profitable again...

I start pumping 100s of millions of my Net worth into it... and I make it look legit by every now and then throwing a few
million at a charitable cause... but it of course has to have added benefits too and further my agenda (these amounts are

not even close to the tax write off I get, not mind the appreciation of the assets I have in there)

I'm good friends with Bill Gates since we setup our first Charter School in 2006 who advises me to setup a Private

Foundation just like his

BUT REALISTICALLY... I know that most of my money will be going through my DAF... and even after I got divorced and

shut down my Private Foundation... I still made 10s of millions in donations from an organization that has no public-

facing information, no tax returns, an unknown sum of AUM and I'm not accountable to anyone for it!!

But maybe for public perception I better keep open a Private Foundation under Citadels name, that doesn't really do

anything...

So I am making BILLIONS of dollars in personal wealth now...

I control the vast Majority of Trade in the US through my Company...

I pay virtually no taxes...

I get to push my agenda on how I want society to look through my contributions which are essentially only the dividends

from my personal assets under management...

And I crack the TOP 10 Biggest Hedge Funds...

Then this happens...

(Speculation)

I decide to make a trade through my personal DAF on a little company called

It doesn't go quite the way I want it... so FUCK IT... I'm TOO SMART to take a loss...

I get the Company Involved and bring in the Might of Citadel... That'll sort them out...

I continue to short the shit out of them as I laugh maniacally watching the Share Price dwindle away...

The end is near and the rewards will be massive for both my company and my personal AUM through my DAF...

I get all my friends in on this and start to push it down further...

But little did I know...

SOMEWHERE... a sharp young man was setting up his room, plugging in his mic... connecting up his camera... and 

getting ready to stream for the first time...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(You beautiful kitty you)

I was going to have to take a Puppy break after putting my mind in the place of Kenny for so long after writing this far...

but this handsome kitty saved me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The point of all this...

While all this was going on... and Kenny was building his Empire...

What were you doing?

Working 9-5 in a boring office job?

Working hard labor on a building site?

Worrying about the school run tomorrow and trying to remember if you packed the kids lunches?

Getting stoned and playing video games til 4AM, and getting up at 1pm the next day?

IT DOESN'T MATTER...

You probably weren't doing what Kenny was doing

He's prepared!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is their game...

They have been mastering this craft of taking our money, for decades now... and we didn't even know we were part of a

game...

The CHIPS ARE STACKED AGAINST US...

But we have finally opened our eyes...

We are finally fighting back... gaining wrinkles each and every day...

They have been at this for generations... we ONLY JUST GOT IN THE GAME...

Are you IMPATIENT???

Good... Buy and Hold!

Are you BROKE from buying???

Good!!! HOLD!!!!

Are you sick of learning more about the corruption and monstrosities that go on at their level?

GOOOD!!! Get Angry and BUY AND HOLD!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's not all going to come crumbling down just because we want it too...

Thanks to the few that have shined their torches for us... we have a path to bring it down... Just by Buying and holding...

and I'll say this too...

There was 1 other phrase of wisdom imparted on us...

Apes Together Strong...

I've been seen this a little less recently.

Not just mod drama shit... but even apes shitting on other apes because they disagree with something... shill or no shill...

(How about instead of trying to accuse everyone of being a shill... we just be extra nice to anyone we think is a

shill? That way... if they are a shill... they won't know what to do... and if it's just an Ape having a bad day...

you've got their back by being nice to them!)

It doesn't matter.

Of course there is a lot of frustration out there... and it's easy to let emotion get the better of us...

(*Queue Dramatic Music)

But if Apes Together Strong fails...

Then buying and holding fails...

And if buying and holding fails...

Then the Cycle of corruption will continue.

This is not meant as FUD...

There is nothing to be FUD about...

This is just a reminder to remember...

Remember WHY you are here...

Remember WHO you are here for...

Remember WHAT this means for you...

And remember HOW you got here...

KENNY is smart...

Whatever about Evil... he is smart...

And he is BANKING on us Crumbling...

It's up to EACH of you and me to prevent this from happening

(Yes even YOU ape!)

His weakness is his Ego... and we are slowly chipping away at it.

It's ours to lose now...

So...

How about TOGETHER we be the Apes we know we can be?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know this is a little off-topic from the usual BBC, but you Apes inspired me with this train of thought from all the positive

feedback I got on yesterday's BBC... so I felt it was worth getting into...

IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THIS FORMAT... LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMENTS SO I KNOW NOT TO DO IT AGAIN...

Ok... the first lesson of a Good BBC is to check the Charities...

Stevey has the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation and quotes that he has given out $625 Million across 3,032
Grants over the last 19 years... as per his website: https://www.steveandalex.org/

FIRST...

His fucking website...

In 2019... he spent $220,000 on the website

In 2018... he spent $42,113 on the website

In 2017... he spent $78,050 on the website

In 2016... he spent $62,400 on the website

So in a 4 year period... he spent $402,563 on his website???

Apes... I work in Digital Marketing... and believe me when I tell you this... his website did NOT cost $402,563!!

I mean sure... it's got some fancy animations, but it's a Wordpress site with a Pro Theme... That's it!

Oh... but maybe he's spending that amount on Marketing his website?

Nope... he's got a separate line item for that... Content... nope... hosting? He gets fuck all traffic so NOPE!

Now... I don't take this lightly...

You could say maybe he's spending on SEO... buying Backlinks... SOMETHING...

Here's his SEMrush report:

Fair enough... he's got a decent authority score... but he's not even running ads...

He gets 10k hits a month... and that only increased in the last year...

If he is paying $400k for these results... he is either GETTIN
he's REALLY BAD at running a business...

G RIPPED OF

 by some SLICK sales Digital Marketer... or

Neither makes sense... SO>

> LIES!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing...

2019 - He spent 600k... BUT HE'S NOT RUN

NIN

G ADS?

You may say... maybe he did in 2019?

If he did... he'd have more than just Google Analytics tracking on his website so he can actually see the results of his

$600k in marketing right?

Well if you know how to read HTML you can go in and verify that all he has is Analytics: view-

source:https://www.steveandalex.org/

But ANYWAY... I suppose he can argue that he is using it for PR... not MARKETING... or some bullshit...

FUCK... I'm pissed off already...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awww... look at the little puppy in a Raincoat!!!

Are you hiding grom me??? Yes you are! Yes you Are!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, let's get into what we're here to get into...

In 2019... The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation received a total of $2,088 in donations

(FUCK... that $600k in Marketing went a LONG way didn't it!!>>>>???)

F
>
BUT...

They made $9

9,000,000 in

 DIVIDENDS.

Fuck me... that's a lot!)

And they gave out $101 million in donations.

Now... the BEST dividend rate from stock in the market right now is Gilead Sciences at 4.12%...

So if his entire fund was in Gilead, that $9

9 million would mean his fund must be...

But... his ACTUAL investment BOOK VALUE is $

 or Ma

e of $
t V

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Ok... Maybe he has preferred shares?

According to Forbes ( source) in 2021 the highest yielding Preferred Shares are Jon Hancock Premium Dividend Fund...

at 8.6%...

So MATH.

Would still put the fund requirement at

...

I honestly don't know here Apes...

This seems suspect to me.

He's getting a 19

% yield on

 DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST???

Ah

. w

. N

w I SEE!

He's invested his charity's money through  Po

2 Ca

l INTL II LTD!

How did I not think of that!

So he MUST be getting crazy returns for his clients then too right?

Hmmmm....

According to this article... Source

Stevey in 2019 returned 14.9

% for clients

 NET OF FEES.

But charges 2.85

% Fees....

So... Lets see here...

14.9% + 2.85% = 17.75%

But...

His charity generated 19.1% returns...

That's a 1.35% difference...

THIS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE MUCH... BUT IN THIS WORLD... IT'S A FUCK TON...

No accusations...

BUT IS STEVEY CUTTING A BIT OFF THE TOP OF HIS CLIENTS MONEY?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So let's take a look at what he's spending these HARD-EARNED gains on then, shall we?

Remember our BBC Benefits Category Guide?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how did Stevey fair in 2019?

BIGGEST DONATIONS...

Museum of Modern Art - $10,500,000 - ART 

New York Presbyterian Fund - $7,700,000 - HEALTHCARE 

Northwell Health Foundation - $5,000,000 - HEALTHCARE

God's Love we Deliver - $1,200,000 - Meals for the poor? X

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok PRETTY close to 100%...

But there's one more on this list that is going to get VERY HEATED...

But wait for it...

Cohen Veterans Network - $47,000,000 - HELPING VETS WITH PTSD X

And it's the BIGGEST donation???

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now I know you American's are VERY patriotic and anyone helping the Vets is doing good...

But I did tell you that ELITE PHILANTHROPY TENDS TO BE ABOUT ELITE CAUSES... Right?

So in 2018... an article in ProPublica found that The Cohen Network was closing it's clinic in Los Angeles less
than a year after it opened. The Cohen Network's leaders had alienated the staff there, former employees said,

by telling them to prioritize healthier patients over homeless veterans.

This is SPECULATED as the privatization of Mental Health Treatment for VAs in America... and I'm GUESSING many of
you already know all about this... RIGHT??

The article continues with:

A thorough examination of the Cohen Network’s record — including internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews

with current and former employees — reveals a different story from the one the Cohen Network tells about itself.

The clinic at the University of Southern California (Also on the above Donation list) was doomed by the Cohen
Network’s mismanagement and insistence on a narrow focus that helped only a subset of veterans, former employees

said.

“The model we ended up believing would really serve veterans was different than the model the Cohen Network was

proposing all clinics operate under,” said Marv Southard, who served as CEO of the Cohen clinic at USC and is now

chair of USC’s doctor of social work program.

There's a lot more to read in here for any Apes that are interested.

Source

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a 2016 NYTimes article... Cohen is quoted as saying that:

With veterans, Mr. Cohen makes clear that this is his project alone, separate from the charitable work his family

foundation has done under the oversight of his wife, Alexandra. (Their family foundation, which gives away about $50

million a year, has focused on causes like children’s health and Lyme disease.)

Source

-- So he's SAYING that his foundation is not involved in the Cohen Network... YA?

Well I had a look...

In 2016, the time of this article... the foundation donated $10,500,000 to the Cohen Veterans Network...

More Lies?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dam I BADLY need a puppy break!!

CUPPIE #2 ... Awww.... aren't you the CUTEST puppy in a cup I've ever seen>????

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well I thought to myself...

Ok... BADASSTRADER...

Think this through...

The Cohen Foundation, Invests their $500 million in Point 72... Gets the VIP returns rate of 19.1%... then uses these

profits to donate to causes that further his agenda...

But it costs him nothing... ok...

Well $47 million goes to the Cohen Veterans Network...

Let's take a look at that company right???

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well taking a look at the Cohen Veterans Network... 2018 (2019 not available yet)

The MAIN donor is Cohen's Foundation... this is expected...

He pays out Salaries to senior staff in the 6 figures... ok...

Spends $1.6 million on Marketing... hmmm

Website and Client Portal costs $29k.... (Pfff ha ha ha ha!) - Remember how much he spent on his funds website...
BULLSHIT!!!

And then most of the rest gets donated out to the individual Military Family Clinics...

Now... I had a look at these Military Family Clinics... and these all look to be the real deal.

Government-funded initiatives with the sole purpose of helping vets and their families...

So what was the story with CVN here?

Cohen has his clinics listed at these Military Family Clinics around the country...

It SEEMS like...

He donates to the Military Family Clinic, provides a grant to get his own team in there and set them up... then funds the
team and trains them to provide care using their UNIQUE methods...

Could be completely wrong... but...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He did say that: Mr. Cohen makes clear that this is his project alone...

Though it SEEMS that he just takes a portion of his profits... Hires a team of execs... gets them to donate to Family
Clinics around the country and has smaller teams installed along side them...

Hmmm............

Though the Military Family Clinics he is partnering are WAY more funded, have WAY more staff... and seem to be doing
a good job from the outside looking in...

Maybe it's nothing... but I wanted to get some independent reviews of this place.

If he's in all these clinics around the country, shouldn't there be some feedback besides the fact that they are de-

prioritising homeless vets?

I took a look at their facebook page: Source

Out of the last 24 posts... not 1 comment...

HMMM..... that's weird.

Then they went live back in June 28th... and they got 2 comments saying they were great...

Lets keep digging...

Another 9 posts with 0 comments...

Lots of likes no comments...

Then again a live stream and they had 2 people commenting...

Lets dig again...

Finally a REAL comment back in June 16, but not about CVN

Too many posts not enough real engagement...

GlassDoor says its an amazing place to work source

Urrgghhh....

Not finding anything REAL here...

Same story on LINKEDIN

Same Story on YOUTUBE

Same Story on REDDIT (Shocking - 0 comments)

I scoured the Internet Apes...

I really did...

Cohen has committed to $235 million in funding for this program... and I can see the money going through Salaries and
Donations to Military Family Clinics... but if they are helping all these people how come NO
INDEPENDENT reviews GOOD or BAD are talking about it?

All I can find is POOR efforts at Social Content by their Social Media team... news reports and a few staff stating how
great it is to work there.

I want to be wrong here... I want it to be a great service doing great things...

But it seems to be invisible... at least from a Digital Perspective.

They are running ads and there is a LITTLE bit of traffic going to the site

But that's it... Brick wall other than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Urrrghhghg...

PUPPY BREAK!!!!

Ahhh.... that's better....

mmmmmm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 thing did catch my eye again though...

In 2018... he spent $1.6 million on marketing.

Now most traffic tools don't have much data on this site historically... but Google trends does.

Now this is COMPLETE... speculation... But SEM rush gives me traffic for this year...

With an average of total site visits of about 6k a month...

We can see the graph in Google Trends... and in 2018... lets say those spikes are about double... 

If we then assume no spikes and average it out at the highest peak... we get 12k hits per month. 

12 x 12 = 144,000 website visits for the year... and it cost him $1.6 million?

And no1 is talking about them? They can't even get views or comments on their Youtube Channel?

COULD IT BE THAT THIS IS ALL JUST A PUBLICITY PLAY???

I dunno... I'm tired... it's late... this is shit... and it simply doesn't make sense...

I'm reaching to try and make this company be legit... but I just can't see it???

I have a feeling my work here is just beginning 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me leave you with this point...

Wanna know how to get away with Insider Trading?

Just say you didn't read the Email...

So in this episode, I decided to take a trip abroad...

To the Cayman Islands that is!

And while I'm there, why not take a look under the hood of all the Private Investment Funds Kenny Keeps 

over there and a few other of your favorites too!

TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT:

Citadel Assets Under Management (AUM) = $35 Billion as of Oct 2020

Estimate Cost to CURE world hunger by 2030 = $330 Billion also as of Oct 2020

(Source)

How much money does Kenny keep in the Caymans in his Private Funds? = $269 BILLION (Nice!) - Spread 

across 16 Funds in the Caymans as of 2021-03-31

- Not exact as it's way too many digits to type into my Calculator...

(I wonder why he likes to setup his funds there? Must be the WEATHER!... ya that's it, the WEATHER!)

(Source)

As of 2020-11-25 he had $254.2 Billion Parked in his Sunny Paradise

As of 2020-05-28 he had $265.5 Billion Parked in his Sunny Paradise

As of 2020-03-30 he had $259.6 Billion Parked in his Sunny Paradise

So it does seem like there is quite a bit of movement throughout the year through these funds...

Anyway...

I decided to look into some of them.

BUT BEFORE WE DO...

DID ANYONE HAPPEN TO NOTICE THIS?

As of first quarter 2021, Citadel Advisors LLC ran a Private Equity funding of $85 million for BLIZZARD??

I wonder why Kenny wants to get directly involved in the gaming world????

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------

The biggest fund by far is the CITADEL GLOBAL FIXED INCOME MASTER FUND LTD.

Last Reported, this had $117 Billion in it.

According to their 13F filings, Kenny owns 5% of these funds directly through CITADEL ADVISORS LLC and 

75% of these funds indirectly through CITADEL GP LLC

- But OBVIOUSLY other investors are putting money in here  This is not all Kenny's Money.

CITADEL GLOBAL FIXED INCOME MASTER FUND LTD listed their FORM D with the SEC, to qualify as a

Cayman Islands Tax Exempted Company here

(Source)

Listed as the Related Persons to this Form D are the following:

Shawn Fa gan - We know him
Kirk Davis - Pin High Limited - Bermuda
Peter Huber Maples Fiduciary Services - Cayman Islands 
Clarendon Masters - Midsea Consulting Limited - Bermuda

So... a quick search on Offshore Leads Database, gives us an idea of the players involved here... how they 
are connected, why some are based in Bermuda and some in the Caymans, and introduces us to a few more 
NEW players and rabbit holes to go down.

(Source)

But let's come back to this...

FIRST... as good Ape DD demands... let's check if this pattern persists shall we? 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------

POINT72 - Cayman Islands

$113,025,630,560 across 9 Funds in the Caymans as of April 2021

AQR Capital Management - Cayman Islands

$38,950,849,358 across 31 funds in the Caymans as of May 2021

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------

So it's safe to say... the pattern holds up.

And of course... Finance Guys using LEGAL offshore accounting practices to avoid tax is nothing new.

I'm sure most of you just assume this happens, but it's how it's stacked against us that gets me really 

pissed off.

But before we blow a gasket... 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------

PUPPY BREAK!!

Awww... look at you in your suit! Aren't you so cute! Are you dressed up for a job interview???

I hope you're not applying to be a banker!

​
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------

So the whole thing about Offshore accounts...

We know people get in trouble for that shit.

But it is LEGAL... once it's SETUP right.

But who the fuck knows if it's setup right or not?

You think you could go out there and setup an offshore account yourself so you can keep your Post Moass 

profits tax-free?

You think your local accountant around the corner can do that with 100% confidence he's not going to fuck it 
up and get you arrested?

But Hedgefunds fucking know...

BUT... they can't just open that up as a service to the general population otherwise NOBODY would be paying 
tax and the government would not be able to function...

So what do they do?
They set massive MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS to be even considered entry into these funds (Which is 100%
legal of course)
But basically... this LEGAL rule means thisâ€¦
Work 9-5 pay taxes
Get a pay rise for working harder... pay MORE taxes
Figure out a way to make $10 million... don't worry about paying ANY taxes anymore. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citadel Fund Minimum Requirements
CITADEL EQUITY FUND LTD. - $0
CEIF INTERNATIONAL LTD. - $0
CITADEL MULTI-STRATEGY EQUITIES MASTER FUND LTD. -$0

CITADEL TREASURY INTERNATIONAL LTD. - $0

CITADEL TACTICAL TRADING LTD. - $100,000

CITADEL QUANTITATIVE STRATEGIES MASTER FUND LTD. - $0

CITADEL PRESIDIO FUND LLC - $150,000,000

CITADEL KENSINGTON GLOBAL STRATEGIES FUND II LTD. - $10,000,000

CITADEL EQUITIES FUND LTD. - $10,000,000

CITADEL TACTICAL MASTER FUND LTD. - $0

But what about the funds that have $0 minimum requirements Mr BadassTrader? Can I get into one of those?

No dearest sweet ape… no1 gets into those! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------

So how do Citadel Do it?

Before I dive in… JUST REMEMBER... this part is SPECULATION… because 1, I can’t prove anything and 2, 

this is ENTIRELY LEGAL anyway!

Ok, so let's pretend for a minute that I'm Ken Griffin (Urrgh)... and I want to hide some money offshore for 

both myself and my clients so we don't have to pay pesky taxes like regular people...

What do I do?

SIMPLE!

I pick up the phone to my friends at PricewaterhouseCoopers LTD. and I ask them, to set me up a 

company in the Bahamas that I can trade money through.

You see, as Ken Griffin, I already know that PricewaterhouseCoopers are EXPERTS at setting up these funds 
offshore... here's a few more they have done:

​
\(Who better to have setup your tax haven's than your Tax Auditor??\)

And PWHC are SUCH experts at this, that they have the FORMULA down to a TEE...

To start, in order to make the company appear legit... you NEED A MAN ON THE GROUND!

That's where Kirk Davis comes in...

See PWHC know Kirk Davis well, they know he can be trusted and probably won't ask too many questions 
once we keep him on a good payroll...

In FACT... they have used him several times before:

​
President and Director of Constellation 
Investment Partners Ltd... also AUDITED by 
PWHC

​
President and Director of Slayden Partners Ltd... 
also AUDITED by PWHC

And in FACT... Kirk has an AMAZING CV... he is listed as President, Director or Secretary on 48 different 

companies (THAT WE KNOW OF) and funds setup under Bermuda Jurisdiction!

Source

So let's give Citdel's Kensington Fund to Kirk! He's our man! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------

Think it's just a coincidence?

Meet Edward Stern... President and Director of 9 different PWHC funds...

Source1 Source2 Source3 Source4 Source5 Source6 Source7 Source8 Source9

And more outside of PWHC

Source 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------

Next on the list... We need a secretary on the Ground...

Same principle as before, but this time we will use Janet Moore (Secretary for 71 funds)

Source

​
Now, we are also going to need a Trustee... and that's gotta be Appleby Services...

(Trustee for 3,449 funds and entities under Bermuda Jurisdiction)

Source

​
Ok...

Now we're rocking...

We've paid off everyone we need to pay off... we have our "STAFF" on the ground so everything LOOKS legit 

and we've covered all the legal requirements...

Mr Griffin... your TAX-FREE COMPANY is ready to go...

GREAT! Let me wire transfer $13.2 Billion

And that Apes and Apettes, is how we setup a LEGAL tax-haven that has NO regulatory requirements, and 

can take money from anyone in the US and transfer it offshore.

Pretty neat huh? 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------

Now... just remember that in 2013, the US Government blocked American's from using these tax havens 

Source

But I sure am glad they kept the back door open for the super-rich... RIGHT?

And according to this report, this accounts for $400 billion in tax losses EVERY YEAR...

Source

But honestly... I think that figure is MASSIVELY underestimated, as it's global across ALL tax havens and 

what I've listed above is just a few hedge funds in 1 destination!

I'm pooped for this round, but more on the Cayman saga coming soon!

If you like this series... please let me know what you think in the comments! Really helps keep me focused!

First off - to address all the attention 10.1 getting removed got.

Besides the fact that it was all over the Hot page of Superstonk, besides the fact that it made it to the top 5 of r/All,

besides the fact that loads of you beautiful Apes took action and made sure it got attention by cross-posting, upvoting

etc...

I just wanted to say this...

From my perspective, that was all one of the coolest things I've ever seen.

I know there have been bigger incidents in the GME saga etc, but I got to see firsthand the community coming together 

and sticking up for something you guys believed in.

When the post got removed, I was a little pissed off and figured it was a waste of work and I'd prob just call it quits at that 

point. Said I'd post it, expecting 20 -30 upvotes.

But seeing the reaction was inspiring.

You Apes are Inspiring!

Ok onto today's episode!

Let's kick this episode off with this...

(Dated: July 14, 2020)
FBI concerned over laundering risks in private equity, hedge funds - leaked 
document

Source (Reuters)

While you can feel free to read the full article above, I am going to directly quote a lot of this as I believe this is something

that everyape should know about.

“The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation believes firms in the nearly $10-trillion private investment funds industry are
being used as vehicles for laundering money at scale, according to a leaked intelligence bulletin prepared by the agency

in May.”

Opening fucking paragraph...

So the FBI believes that the $10-Trillion private investment funds industry are being used as vehicles for money
laundering???

First-off $10-Trillion????

In BBC 10.1 I thought the estimates for offshore tax haven private funds was small at $400 Billion, and while I know that

not EVERY Private Investment Fund is Offshore, there certainly seems to me like ALOT MORE POTENTIAL of tax
avoidance, if the FBI estimates the value at $10 Trillion??

Honestly...

Is it just me?

Am I losing the plot?

Fuck it... Early Puppy Break!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aww... who's a good guard dog! Yes you guys are good guard dogs!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The information that made up the basis for this article came from LEAKED LAW ENFORCEMENT DOCUMENTS

The biggest Data-Leak relating to the Police force in history... AKA BLUELEAKS
BlueLeaks, sometimes referred to by the Twitter hashtag #BlueLeaks, refers to 269 gigabytes of internal U.S. law 
enforcement data obtained by the hacker collective Anonymous and released on June 19, 2020 by the activist group 

Distributed Denial of Secrets, which called it the "largest published hack of American law enforcement agencies.
The Blueleaks data has SINCE BEEN REMOVED almost entirely from the Internet, so we do not have an original source 
here to reference.

But if you want to check out some of the background on this and all the other information that was exposed, the best 

place I've found is using the Twitter Hashtag.

BUT....

At the time of the leak, a press release was issued by Reuters which gave us this article and at the time of the article, all

the data was still online...

SO REUTERS HAD SOURCES FOR THEIR ARTICLE - And we will use their article as the source for this one.

(Hope that makes sense, if it wasn't Reuters I'd probably discount this)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MORE CRAZY SHIT REVEALED:

It also said the industry lacks adequate anti-money laundering programs and called for greater scrutiny by regulators,

which have yet to issue rules for the industry.

The FBI bulletin (SOURCE NO LONGER AVAILABLE) cites four cases of planned or reported laundering operations,

involving hundreds of millions of dollars, using private funds. One of those cases led to a criminal conviction.

“Criminally complicit investment fund managers likely will expand their money laundering operations as private

placement opportunities increase, resulting in continued infiltration of the licit global financial system. If greater

regulatory scrutiny compelled private investment funds to identify and disclose to financial institutions the underlying

beneficial owners of investments, this would reduce the appeal of these investment firms to threat actors, at which

time the FBI will re-visit this assessment,”

The FBI’s assessment is made with “high-confidence”, the bulletin read.

So the FBI, has a HIGH-CONFIDENCE that full-on ILLEGAL money-laundering activity is running through these private
funds... AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STOP IT DUE TO A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY!

So back to us...

If the FBI can't catch this shit... what are the chances the SEC can catch their shit? Or the IRS catch their shit?

Is this whole Private Funds thing basically just like the Darkweb? Where anything goes, and no1 is traceable?

The Securities and Exchange Commission describes private funds as pooled investment vehicles that are excluded

from the definition of 'investment company' under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Source behind paywall) which

governs mutual funds. Private funds generally include hedge funds and private equity funds, according to the SEC.

So hedgies are part of this!

Hedge funds wager on public-market equity, debt, derivative, foreign exchange, cryptocurrencies, and other liquid

investments. The conventional PE strategy similarly uses high amounts of debt purchase underperforming companies

or corporate assets, which managers then restructure.

Unlike hedge funds, PE vehicles are illiquid, with long investor lockups being a signature of the asset class. Both asset

classes cater exclusively to institutional clients and accredited investors, or people whose net worth exceed $1 million.

(Interesting that their net worth floor is $1 million, similar to what I suspected in 10.1)

Over the last several years, hedge funds have fallen out of favor among many institutional investors, while private

equity funds and other private markets vehicles have continued to grow in assets under management,” said Bryce

Klempner, a partner at consultants McKinsey & Company in Boston.

So there's more and more going into these Private Funds!!

The bulletin cites four cases in which hedge funds and PE firms “have been used to facilitate transactions in support of

fraud, transnational organized crime, and sanctions evasion”. Intelligence in the report was collected between March

2017 and July 2019.

They know crimes are being committed using these channels and have already been flagged by them!!

First, the FBI highlights the case of Mark Scott, the disgraced partner of a major U.S. law firm, who was convicted in

New York last year of helping the operators of initial coin offering scam OneCoin launder more than $400 million.

The FBI omits mention of Scott by name, but describes how fraud funds were moved and concealed “through a series

of purported private equity funds holding accounts at financial institutions, including those in the Cayman Islands” and

Ireland. Details of the Scott case match the FBI’s account.

Did you FUCKING READ THAT????

Crypto Scams are using Private Funds to conceal their money through the CAYMAN ISLANDS>????

(And Ireland of all places??!)

So this isn't just THEORY any more apes... This ACTUALLY HAPPENED and is documented in ongoing investigations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok this bit is a big block of text... but trust me Apes... it's worth it!

Enabling the activity are private fund incorporation and operating structures that disproportionately favor bank secrecy

jurisdictions, particularly Delaware state and the Cayman Islands. These locales are the most popular domestic and

offshore destinations to set up general partnerships for global hedge funds and PE funds, respectively.

Hedge funds and private equity firms receive funds from entities registered in nations that maintain laws conducive to

masking underlying beneficial owners,” which makes it harder for U.S. financial institutions and regulators to

determine the source of funding, the FBI bulletin read.

As of April 2019, some 70% of these private investment advisers were domiciled in the Cayman Islands, according to

an article written in Cayman Funds Magazine by a partner at offshore law firm Carey Olson. A total of 20% of dollar

funding to global banks comes from the Caymans, according to a Q3 2019 Bank of International Settlements report.

Martin Kenney, a British Virgin Islands-based asset recovery attorney who has represented victims of hedge-fund

swindler Allen Stanford and other frauds, said: “It stands to reason that a not-insignificant proportion of the capital

managed by private investment funds is dark money.

So it's essentially confirmed that everything is as I've suspected. These funds are Dark Money, with little traceability, little
regulation and poor anti-money laundering structures, not to mention the POTENTIAL for tax evasion, stock market
manipulation and so on...

So NO WONDER... so many Hedgies have SO MANY funds both in the Caymans and other Private Fund favorite
destinations!

Fuckin Puppy Break!

Here puppies! It's Dinner Time!

Who's hungry???

Ok so...

There's lots more in that article and I do suggest you Apes read it!

But the other big thing I got from it was... while I was schooling myself through this article, I found a reference to a new

type of form that I never heard of that offered public-facing information.

Form ADV…

No not DFV, ADV...

So this form requires our favorite Hedgie Allstars to PUBLICALLY disclose information about all their private funds…

Now, before we jump into the meat of this, there is a section before going into the information that LISTS Citadel

Advisors LLC Alternate names.

Source

Did you KNOW that Citadel Advisors LLC is also known as ASHLER CAPITAL LLC???

STOP lying… no you didn’t!

I searched Reddit for Reference of Ashler Capital and…

Feel free to check them out: https://www.citadel.com/investment-strategies/ashler-capital/

But anyway… that’s not why we came here. Let’s take a look at all the PRIVATE FUNDS that Citadel have disclosed.

(Remember those Private funds that the FBI are worried about?)

This is a LONG document, but anyone that likes mildly interesting boring information can take a look through it here…

SOURCE

But the synopsis is:

The Document outlines the LIST of all Citadel Private funds. Similar to what we discussed in BBC Ep. 10

But not just the Cayman Islands you see…

Kenny has many Private funds, either in the Caymans or US (Often Delaware)...

But the INTERESTING thing about this form, is it also lists the CUSTODIANS of these funds…

Yes Tom... I said Custodians of these Private Funds.

You see custodians are entities listed that have permission to control a portion of these given funds.

NOW…

I’m sure all you apes Remember BrazilGate ya?

The missing Puts that disappeared in Brazil?

Well let’s take a look at who Kenny TRUSTS HIS MONEY TO… shall we?

(I probably actually missed some, because that’s a lot of scrolling and had to pull these out manually)

But I think you get the idea…

DOES ANYONE ELSE FIND IT STRANGE THAT THE ONLY COUNTRY LISTED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD

HERE IS BRAZIL?

So PLEASE... any apes with a Finance background tell me if I am wrong here...

Let's say I owned a Hedge Fund... and I wanted to move money around the world without raising too many flags...

wouldn't having unregulated private funds set up and granting access to different entities around the world allow me to

do that?

Or... if I had a hedge fund and I wanted to make some puts disappear down in Brazil, wouldn't having Private Funds

setup and granting access to portions of those funds to Banks in Brazil be first step to make that happen?

Even the FBI say they have too little control over this!

NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT ALL THESE FUNDS ARE BASED IN TAX HAVENS!

FUCKING PUPPY BREAK
