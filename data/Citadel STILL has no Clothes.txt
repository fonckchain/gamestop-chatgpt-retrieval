Citadel Still Has No Clothes - Feb 28, 2022

 Due Diligence

TL:DR

Citadel Securities upped their short position during 2021 and Citadel Advisors is even more fuller of hot air than

in 2020. They also had a FINRA orgy with 14 different exchanges over erroneous pricing practices between 2014

and
2020. ___________________________________________________________________________________________

It's FINALLY HERE..

At long last, Citadel Securities has published their financials for 2021 and I've done me a dabble or two. If you haven't

read Citadel Has No Clothes, please do so before reading on.

Before I go balls-deep into this b*tch, let me start off by updating our total brokercheck.finra.org report on Citadel

Securities. At the time of writing my first piece back in March 2021, we were at 58 total violations. As of writing, Citadel
Securities has achieved another 15 violations, bringing Kenny's grand total to 73.

*light applause*

To be fair, 14 of these violations were for the same thing... they were just hit by 14 different exchanges at the same

time... *Insert black guys & blonde girl meme*

NASDAQ MRX, LLC

CBOE EDGX Exchange, INC

CBOE BZX Exchange, INC

CBOE BYX Exchange, INC

CBOE EDGA Exchange, INC

NAXDAQ ISE, LLC

NASDAQ Options Market, LLC

NASDAQ GEMX, LLC

NASDAQ Stock Market

NASDAQ PHLX, LLC

NASDAQ BX, INC

NYSE

NYSE ARCA, INC

NYSE National, INC

Their other violation from 3/2021 was covered in my post 'Walkin Like A Duck'.. Check it out.

...Anyway..

If my maff is correct, that means Kenny G did himself a heckin' naughty and racked up another 25.86% of his TOTAL
violations in just one year.

*little bigger applause*.

Now let's remember, although these violations were published in December 2021, they were an accumulation of issues

from prior years. In fact, the earliest date I found was August 15th, 2014 and the most recent was in May or June
2020.. So that's 1 issue, reported by 14 different exchanges, across 6 years, totaling... $225,000 *little fart noise*

Before I make anyone think the sky is falling- this is NOT a monumental fine.. This is just what has been reported by

FINRA during 2021. I'll explain why I find it interesting in a sec but I need to preface these things because I know

someone out there will say "tHaTs NoT tHaT bIg Of A dEaL, RoBiNhOoD hAd A bIgG...."... I promise you, I know.

At any rate, here's the violation:

Right off the bat, we have Citadel's signature violation "IT FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN REASONABLE 
RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS AND SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES" ... BLAH BLAH BLAH.

Long story short, here's why I think this matters:

When an option order is placed, Citadel has a price control mechanism that would reject orders priced at a "certain 

percentage" away from the NBBO. This makes sense.. no big deal.. You shouldn't execute on trades that are too far 

outside of the best bid. However, if that order is cancelled and replaced, you should repeat this process... which clearly 

didn't happen.

When an order is placed, it is often broken into several "child orders". This allows trade blocks to execute and complete 

the order at the best price for the customer. If too many of those child orders are outside of the NBBO, the blocks should 

stop executing until either the order is cancelled or the NBBO is back at the appropriate price.. If this system doesn't 

work appropriately, it will complete the order outside of the NBBO.. Hopefully you can see where this would be a major 

disadvantage to the customer.

What's interesting here is the language "The firms erroneous order controls ... included a price control that would
reject limit orders that were priced at a certain percentage away from the NBBO"..

..then..

"However, when an option order was cancelled and replaced, the price control was NOT applied to the replaced

option orders."

So... all 14 of these exchanges would receive limit option orders from Citadel before the market opened. If Citadel

replaced the original order after the orders were sent to those exchanges, ALL of those orders would execute without

appropriately reviewing the new parameters set by the replacement order....

That's NUTS!

Even more alarming is the lack of documentation that their personnel were supposed to follow in these situations. I know

things get hectic for traders and it's hard to keep track of everything. We're all human and sh*t happens, but SURELY

someone at Citadel noticed this occurring before the hammer had to come down, externally. Every past violation seems

to highlight Citadel's lack of "give a f*ck" when it comes to these things. It just leaves a sour taste in the mouth..

I'm sure everyone knows about the DOJ investigations going on right now. These issues can have a direct impact on

their ability to manipulate prices. Intentional or not, if you're aware of these issues and fail to fix them, you're
guilty. PERIOD.

MEAT N' POTATOES, TIME

Recall from Citadel Has No Clothes that Citadel ADVISORS had roughly $385,000,000,000 (that's billion) in assets
under management in 2020... That consisted of roughly 76.7% derivatives and less than 25% of actual, physical
assets....

I was shocked to learn that initially, but after following their filings through 2021, I realized it was basically their bread n'

butter. According to the most recent report on https://whalewisdom.com/, their AUM as of 12/31/2021 had increased by

over $100,000,000,000 (again, billion).

But that "increase" doesn't really represent true value... In fact, it's the highest-risk profile I've ever seen. Here's the
market value of their equities & derivatives on 12/31/2020:

AAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNDDDDDDDD here's the AUM for year-end 2021....

Market value of physical equities is up 7.88%.... and their derivative values are up almost 37%?!?!

37%?!?!?!!?!! IN ONE YEAR?!?!?! THEIR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO IS NOW 82.59% DERIVATIVES...

I've waited an entire year for someone to show me one other firm that has this type of portfolio.... or WHY it would be a

smart idea..

If you're not sure what this means, I'm saying more than 80% of their portfolio is a STRAIGHT- UP gamble. Over 9% of

their portfolio is a bet on Tesla... (they're bullish FYI).

Hell, almost 7% of their portfolio are SPY PUTS.

THIS NOW MAKES TWO YEARS IN A ROW THAT I'M AWARE OF.. NOT ONE, BUT TWO....

WANNA KNOW SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE NUMBER TWO? IT'S ALMOST THE SAME
NUMBER OF PHYSICAL SHARES THAT CITADEL ACTUALLY OWNS..

Moving on..

Citadel Securities upped their short position to $65 billion this year. It's the highest since......

2020....

which was the highest since......

2019...

which was the highest since.... here, just take a look at this:

Basically, Citadel Securities' holds over 87% of their liabilities as short obligations. This is split between options and

equities, which is nothing new for them...

Interestingly, they haven't had this level of short liability since right before the financial crisis of 2008... If I were to make a

guess, I'd say they are betting against..... well.... everything? I wish I had their whalewisdom.com reports so I could

compare how Citadel Securities scales with their hedge fund's prior filings. Would be interesting to see if the shorts are

outgrowing their physical assets...

well that's not a fair statement because anything can grow quicker than their physical asset portfolio.

But you know what DOESN'T have problems growing? Their #SHORTS
