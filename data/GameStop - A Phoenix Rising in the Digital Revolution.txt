GameStop: A Phoenix Rising in the Digital RevolutionAndrés FonsecaAndrés FonsecaBlockchain developer, gamer, value investor & abolitionistLast published Jun 167 min read·Jun 16. In the world of finance, GameStop (GME) has been a focal point of discussion, controversy, and transformation. The company, once written off as the next Blockbuster, has emerged as a symbol of retail investor power and the potential for market reform. The recent annual shareholder meeting held on June 15th, 2023, marked once again, a significant milestone in GameStop’s journey, showcasing the company’s resilience and its promising future.Leadership and ManagementGameStop’s financial performance has been improving quarter over quarter, led by a dream team of management. At the helm is Ryan Cohen, also known as the “book king”, or “papa cohen”, who has been recently appointed as the executive chairman. Cohen, co-founder of Chewy, brings a wealth of incredibly successful e-commerce experiences and a vision for transforming GameStop into the epicenter of gaming.In the latest annual shareholder meeting, Cohen addressed his shareholders, emphasizing his commitment to aligning the interests of management with those of the shareholders. He stated, “My responsibility is making sure GameStop is run by managers who treat company money like their own.” This ethos is a refreshing departure from the norm in corporate America, where executives traditionally prioritize short-term gains over long-term value creation at the shareholder's expense.Ryan’s philosophy extends beyond mere words. Unlike many executives who rely on stock grants as their primary form of compensation, Cohen and his team have put their own money where their mouth is by continuously purchasing company shares. This aligns their interests directly with those of the shareholders and underscores their commitment to the company’s success.In his closing remarks, Cohen stated:“I like people who roll up their sleeves and do real work. People guided by principles, not robots who seek to rest and vest. In corporate America there’s no shortage of overpaid executives, bad capital allocation, and chronic waste and serial delegators. Much as this behavior is both predictable and reprehensible, it’s precisely what creates opportunities. Thank you for being a shareholder.”Financeiro PerformanceHere are the key financial highlights from GameStop’s latest two quarters:Q4 2022:Net sales were $2.261 billion, compared to $2.254 billion in Q4 2021.Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $453.4 million, or 20.4% of sales, compared to $538.9 million, or 23.9% of sales, in the prior year’s fourth quarter.Operating income was $46.2 million, a significant improvement compared to an operating loss of $18.8 million in Q4 2021.Net income was $48.2 million, compared to a net loss of $147.5 million in Q4 2021 (A massive 195.7 Million dollar swing).Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.391 billion at the close of the quarter.Q1 2023:Net sales were $1.237 billion for the period, compared to $1.378 billion in the prior year’s first quarter.Selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $345.7 million, or 27.9% of net sales for the period, compared to $452.2 million, or 32.8% of net sales, in the prior year’s first quarter.Net loss was $50.5 million for the period, compared to a net loss of $157.9 million for the prior year’s first quarter (A whopping 107.4 Million dollar swing).Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.310 billion at the close of the quarter.Negligible debt limited to one low-interest, unsecured term loan associated with the French government’s response to COVID-19.These numbers show a clear improvement in GameStop’s financial performance, with increased sales, gross profit, and a return to profitability. The company has managed to turn around its operations, moving from a loss-making position to generating positive net income.Strategic InitiativesIn terms of the company’s strategic positioning, GameStop is making significant strides in becoming a key player in the digital gaming revolution. The company has embraced disruptive technologies such as blockchain and has been developing a state-of-the-art GameStop marketplace powered by Loopring. This marketplace is set to revolutionize the gaming industry by providing a platform for the exchange of digital assets.In addition, GameStop’s partnership with Immutable X, a leader in the web3 gaming ecosystem, positions the company to capitalize on the effervescent market for blockchain-based games and digital assets. This collaboration not only expands GameStop’s reach but also diversifies its offerings in the rapidly evolving gaming landscape.The recent patenting of GameStop Playr, a web3 gaming launchpad, further exemplifies GameStop’s innovative approach. By integrating Telos’ robust blockchain infrastructure, GameStop Playr is poised to access mainstream gaming distributions, dismantling barriers and fostering a more inclusive gaming ecosystem.These strategic collaborations underscore GameStop’s forward-thinking approach and dedication to pioneering the future of gaming. By leveraging blockchain technology and forming key partnerships, GameStop is not just adapting to the digital revolution, but actively shaping its trajectory. Embodying its motto, “Power to the Players”, GameStop is democratizing the gaming industry, empowering players with more control and opportunities in this rapidly evolving digital landscape.ComunidadeBeyond its financial performance and strategic initiatives, what truly sets GameStop apart is its unique and involved community. Often referred to as ‘apes’, this community has rallied behind GameStop, supporting the company not just through investments but also by creating a vibrant culture around it. This culture is reflected in various forms of creative expression. Incredibly skilled artists like Wooch and TheRealDMT have become popular within the community for their GameStop-inspired music, adding unique soundtracks to this financial revolution. Their music resonates with the community, further strengthening the sense of camaraderie and unity among GameStop supporters.Adding to these lyrical masterpieces is the recent documentary by the Mulligan Brothers, “Apes Together Strong”. This film captures the spirit of the GameStop movement, providing a compelling narrative of the community’s journey and its fight against market manipulation.This community involvement exemplifies the unique phenomenon that GameStop has become, transcending beyond a mere financial investment into a cultural movement. The ‘ape’ community is not just investing in GameStop; they are investing in a cause, and in doing so, they are reshaping the narrative of the financial world.Direct Registration SystemImage taken from Upside ChroniclesIn addition to these strategic initiatives, GameStop has been transparent about its Direct Registration System (DRS) numbers, as shared in its SEC filings. This move is a testament to GameStop’s commitment to ensuring a fair and transparent market.The Direct Registration System (DRS) movement involving GameStop is a unique and powerful initiative that has the potential to reshape the landscape of Wall Street. This movement is driven by GameStop’s retail investors, who are choosing to directly register their shares under their name with the company’s transfer agent, Computershare, rather than holding them in street name through traditional brokerage accounts.The DRS movement is a direct response to the issue of predatory naked short selling, a practice where short sellers sell shares they do not own and have not borrowed, with the hope of buying them back at a lower price. This practice can artificially inflate the supply of a company’s stock, driving down its price. It’s a form of market manipulation that has caused incalculable losses and has not spared any type of companies, even those with noble purposes such as cancer research. This unethical practice has led to financial struggles and even bankruptcy of many companies, causing significant harm to investors and the broader economy.By directly registering their shares, GameStop’s investors are effectively removing these shares from the pool that can be borrowed for short selling. This reduces the ability for abusive naked short selling to occur. As more and more investors choose to directly register their shares, the supply of shares available to borrow decreases, putting pressure on those who have shorted the stock to close their positions.This movement is not just about GameStop; it’s about challenging the status quo of Wall Street. It’s about standing up against market manipulation and advocating for a fair and transparent financial system. The ‘apes’ are not just investors; they are activists, using their collective power to drive change.The DRS movement is a testament to the power of retail investors and their ability to disrupt traditional financial systems. It’s a movement that is gaining momentum, and its impact could be far-reaching. ‘WEN’ successful, it would force those who have engaged in abusive naked short selling to close their positions, potentially leading to MOASS (Mother Of All Short Squeezes), an insanely intense upward movement in the price of GameStop’s stock. This would have a ripple effect throughout Wall Street, challenging the current system and paving the way for greater transparency and fairness in the market.ConclusionGameStop is not just surviving; it’s thriving. The company is leveraging its legacy in the gaming industry and combining it with innovative technologies to create a new future. As GameStop continues to transform and adapt, it stands as a testament to the power of resilience, innovation, and the collective strength of retail investors.I invite you to show your support by clapping for this article and sharing it with your friends.
