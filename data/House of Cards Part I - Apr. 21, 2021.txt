A HOUSE OF CARDS PART 1

PUBLISHED APRIL 22, 2021

U/ATOBITT

TL;DR- The DTC has been taken over by big money. They transitioned
from  a  manual  to  a  computerized  ledger  system  in  the  80s,  and  it
played  a  significant  role  in  the  1987  market  crash.  In  2003,  several
issuers with the DTC wanted to remove their securities from the DTC's
deposit  account  because  the  DTC's  participants  were  naked  short
selling  their  securities.  Turns  out,  they  were  right.  The  DTC  and  it's
participants  have  created  a  market-sized  naked  short  selling  scheme.
All of this is made possible by the DTC's enrollee- Cede & Co.

Holy SH*T!
The  events  we  are  living  through  RIGHT NOW  are  the  50-year  ripple
effects of stock market evolution. From the birth of the DTC to the cesspool
we  currently  find  ourselves  in,  this  DD  will  illustrate  just  how  fragile
the House of Cards has become.

We've been warned so many times... We've made the same mistakes so.

many. times.

And we never seem to learn from them..

_____

In  case  you've  been  living  under  a  rock  for  the  past  few  months,  the
DTCC  has  been  proposing  a  boat  load  of  rule  changes  to  help  better-
monitor their participants' exposure. If you don't already know, the DTCC
stands for Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and is broken into the
following (primary) subsidiaries:

1.  Depository  Trust  Company  (DTC)  -  centralized  clearing  agency  that
makes  sure  grandma  gets  her  stonks  and  the  broker  receives  grandma's
tendies

2. National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) - provides clearing,
settlement, risk management, and central counterparty (CCP) services to its
members for broker-to-broker trades

3.  Fixed  Income  Clearing  Corporation  (FICC)  -  provides  central
counterparty  (CCP)  services  to  members  that  participate  in  the  US
government and mortgage-backed securities markets

Brief  history lesson:  I  promise  it's  relevant  (this link provides  all  the  info
that follows).

The  DTC  was  created  in  1973.  It  stemmed  from  the  need  for  a
centralized clearing company. Trading during the 60s went through the roof
and resulted in many brokers having to quit before the day was finished so
they could manually record their mountain of transactions. All of this was
done  on  paper  and  each  share  certificate  was  physically  delivered.  This
obviously  resulted  in  many  failures  to  deliver  (FTD)  due  to  the  risk  of
human  error  in  record  keeping.  In  1974,  the  Continuous  Net  Settlement
system was launched to clear and settle trades using a rudimentary internet
platform.

In  1982,  the  DTC  started  using  a  Book-Entry  Only  (BEO)  system  to
underwrite bonds. For the first time, there were no physical certificates that
actually  traded  hands.  Everything  was  now  performed  virtually  through
computers.  Although  this  was  advantageous  for  many  reasons,  it  made  it
MUCH easier to commit a certain type of securities fraud- naked shorting.

One  year  later  they  adopted  NYSE  Rule  387  which  meant  most
securities  transactions  had  to  be  completed  using  this  new  BEO  computer
system. Needless to say, explosive growth took place for the next 5 years.
Pretty soon, other securities started utilizing the BEO system. It paved the
way  for  growth  in  mutual  funds  and  government  securities,  and  even
allowed  for  same-day  settlement.  At  the  time,  the  BEO  system  was  a
tremendous  achievement.  However,  we  were  destined  to  hit  a  brick  wall
after  that  much  growth  in  such  a  short  time..  By  October  1987,  that's
exactly what happened.

_____

"A  number  of  explanations  have  been  offered  as  to  the  cause  of  the
crash... Among these are computer trading, derivative securities, illiquidity,
trade and budget deficits, and overvaluation..".

If  you're  wondering  where  the  birthplace  of  High  Frequency  Trading
(HFT) came from, look no further. The same machines that automated the
exhaustively  manual  reconciliation  process  were  also  to  blame  for
amplifying the fire sale of 1987.

https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/895
The  last  sentence  indicates  a  much  more  pervasive  issue  was  at  play,
here. The fact that we still have trouble explaining the calculus is even more
alarming.  The  effects  were  so  pervasive  that  it  was  dubbed  the  1st  global
financial crisis

Here's  another  great  summary  published  by  the  NY Times:  *"..*to  be
fair  to  the  computers..  [they  were]..  programmed  by  fallible  people  and
trusted  by  people  who  did  not  understand  the  computer  programs'
limitations. As computers came in, human judgement went out." Damned
if that didn't give me goosiebumps...

_____

Here's  an  EXTREMELY  relevant  explanation  from  Bruce  Bartlett  on

the role of derivatives:

Notice  the  last  sentence?  A  major  factor  behind  the  crash  was  a
disconnect between the price of stock and their corresponding derivatives.
The value of any given stock should determine the derivative value of that
stock. It shouldn't be the other way around. This is an important concept
to remember as it will be referenced throughout the post.

In  the  off  chance  that  the  market  DID  tank,  they  hoped  they  could
contain  their  losses  with  portfolio insurance. Another  article  from  the  NY
times explains this in better detail.

_____

A major disconnect occurred when these futures contracts were used to
intentionally  tank  the  value  of  the  underlying  stock.  In  a  perfect  world,
organic  growth  would  lead  to  an  increase  in  value  of  the  company

(underlying  stock).  They  could  do  this  by  selling  more  products,  creating
new  technologies,  breaking  into  new  markets,  etc.  This  would  trigger  an
organic  change  in  the  derivative's  value  because  investors  would  be
(hopefully) more optimistic about the longevity of the company. It could go
either way, but the point is still the same. This is the type of investing that
most of us are familiar with: investing for a better future.

I don't want to spend too much time on the crash of 1987. I just want to
identify the factors that contributed to the crash and the role of the DTC as
they  transitioned  from  a  manual  to  an  automatic  ledger  system.  The
connection I  really want  to focus on  is  the ENORMOUS  risk  appetite
these investors had. Think of how overconfident and greedy they must
have  been  to  put  that  much  faith  in  a  computer  script..  either  way,
same problems still exist today.

Finally,  the  comment  by  Bruce  Bartlett  regarding  the  mismatched
investment strategies between stocks and options is crucial in painting the
picture of today's market.

Now,  let's  do  a  super  brief  walkthrough  of  the  main  parties  within  the

DTC before opening this can of worms.

_____

I'm  going  to  talk  about  three  groups  within  the  DTC-  issuers,

participants, and Cede & Co.

Issuers  are  companies  that  issue  securities  (stocks),  while  participants
are  the  clearing  houses,  brokers,  and  other  financial  institutions  that  can
utilize those securities. Cede & Co. is a subsidiary of the DTC which holds
the share certificates.

Participants  have  MUCH  more  control  over  the  securities  that  are
deposited  from  the  issuer.  Even  though  the  issuer  created  those  shares,
participants  are  in  control  when  those  shares  hit  the  DTC's  doorstep.  The

DTC  transfers  those  shares  to  a  holding  account  (Cede  &  Co.)  and  the
participant  just  has  to  ask  "May  I  haff  some  pwetty  pwease  wiff  sugar  on
top?" 

_____

Now, where's that can of worms?
Everything  was  relatively  calm  after  the  crash  of  1987....  until  we  hit

2003..

*deep breath*
The  DTC  started  receiving  several  requests  from  issuers  to  pull  their
securities  from  the  DTC's  depository.  I  don't  think  the  DTC  was  prepared
for this because they didn't have a written policy to address it, let alone an
official rule. Here's the half-assed response from the DTC:

https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm (section II)
Realizing  this  situation  was  heating  up,  the  DTC  proposed  SR-DTC-

2003-02..

https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm#P19_6635
Honestly, they were better of WITHOUT the new proposal.
It  became  an  even  BIGGER  deal  when  word  got  about  the  proposed
rule change. Naturally, it triggered a TSUNAMI of comment letters against
the DTC's proposal. There was obviously something going on to cause that
level of concern. Why did SO MANY issuers want their deposits back?

...you ready for this sh*t?

_____

As outlined in the DTC's opening remarks:

https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm#P19_6635
OK... see footnote 4.....

https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm#P19_6635
UHHHHHHH  WHAT!??!  Yeah!  I'd  be  pretty  pissed,  too!  Have  my
shares  deposited  in  a  clearing  company  to  take  advantage  of  their
computerized trades just to get kicked to the curb with NO WAY of getting
my securities back... AND THEN find out that the big-d*ck "participants"
at  your  fancy  DTC  party  are  literally  short  selling  my  shares  without  me
knowing....?!

....This sound familiar, anyone??? IDK about y'all, but this "trust us with

your shares" BS is starting to sound like a major con.

The DTC asked for feedback from all issuers and participants to gather
a  consensus  before  making  a  decision.  All  together,  the  DTC  received  89
comment letters (a pretty big response). 47 of those letters opposed the rule
change, while 35 were in favor.

To save space, I'm going to use smaller screenshots. Here are just a few

of the opposition comments..

Here's the full list if you wanna dig on your own.
...I  realize  there  are  advantages  to  "paperless"  securities  transfers...
However...  It  is  EXACTLY  what  Michael  Sondow  said  in  his  comment
letter  above..  We  simply  cannot  trust  the  DTC  to  protect  our  interests
when we don't have physical control of our assets**.**

Several  other  participants,  including  Edward  Jones,  Ameritrade,
Citibank, and Prudential overwhelmingly favored this proposal.. How can
someone NOT acknowledge that the absence of physical shares only makes
it easier for these people to manipulate the market....?

This rule change would allow these 'participants' to continue doing this
because it's extremely profitable to sell shares that don't exist, or have not
been collateralized. Furthermore, it's a win-win for them because it  forces
issuers to keep their deposits in the holding account of the DTC...

Ever  heard  of  the  fractional  reserve  banking  system??  Sounds  A  LOT

like what the stock market has just become.

Want  proof  of  market  manipulation?  Let's  fact-check  the  claims  from
the opposition letters above. I'm only reporting a few for the time period we
discussed (2003ish). This is just to validate their claims that some sketchy
sh*t is going on.

1. UBS Securities (formerly UBS Warburg):

a. pg 559; SHORT SALE VIOLATION; 3/30/1999
b. pg 535; OVER REPORTING OF SHORT INTEREST POSITIONS;

c.

2. Merrill Lynch (Professional Clearing Corp.):

a.  pg  158;  VIOLATION  OF  SHORT  INTEREST  REPORTING;

12/17/2001

3. RBC (Royal Bank of Canada):

a.  pg  550;  FAILURE  TO  REPORT  SHORT  SALE  TRANSACTIONS

WITH INDICATOR; 9/28/1999

b. pg 507; SHORT SALE VIOLATION; 11/21/1999
c.  pg  426;  FAILURE  TO  REPORT  SHORT  SALE  MODIFIER;

1/21/2003

Ironically, I picked these 3 because they were the first going down the line..
I'm not sure how to be any more objective about this.. Their entire FINRA
report is littered with short sale violations. Before anyone asks "how do you
know  they  aren't  ALL  like  that?"  The  answer  is-  I  checked.  If  you  get
caught for a short sale violation, chances are you will ALWAYS get caught
for short sale violations. Why? Because it's more profitable to do it and get
caught, than it is to fix the problem.
Wanna know the 2nd worst part?
Several  comment  letters  asked  the  DTC  to  investigate  the  claims  of
naked  shorting  BEFORE  coming  to  a  decision  on  the  proposal..  I  never
saw a document where they followed up on those requests.....

NOW, wanna know the WORST part?

https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm#P99_35478
The DTC passed that rule change....
They not only prevented the issuers from removing their deposits, they
also  turned  a  'blind-eye'  to  their  participants  manipulative  short  selling,
even when there's public evidence of them doing so...

....Those  companies  were  being  attacked  with  shares  THEY  put  in  the

DTC, by institutions they can't even identify...

_____

..Let's take a quick breath and recap:
The DTC started using a computerized ledger and was very successful
through  the  80's.  This  evolved  into  trading  systems  that  were  also
computerized, but not as sophisticated as they hoped.. They played a major
part  in  the  1987  crash,  along  with  severely  desynchronized  derivatives
trading.

In  2003,  the  DTC  denied  issuers  the  right  to  withdraw  their  deposits
because those securities were in the control of participants, instead. When
issuer A deposits stock into the DTC and participant B shorts those shares

into  the  market,  that's  a  form  of  rehypothecation.  This  is  what  so  many
issuers were trying to express in their comment letters. In addition, it hurts
their  company  by  driving  down  it's  value.  They  felt  robbed  because  the
DTC was blatantly allowing it's participants to do this, and refused to give
them back their shares..

It was critically important for me to paint that background.

_____

..now then....
Remember when I mentioned the DTC's enrollee- Cede & Co.?

https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm#P19_6635 (section II)
I'll admit it: I didn't think they were that relevant. I focused so much on

the DTC that I didn't think to check into their enrollee...

..Wish I did....

https://www.americanbanker.com/news/you-dont-really-own-your-

securities-can-blockchains-fix-that

That's  right....  Cede  &  Co.  hold  a  "master  certificate"  in  their  vault,
which  NEVER  leaves.  Instead,  they  issue  an  IOU  for  that  master
certificate..

Didn't  we  JUST  finish  talking  about  why  this  is  such  a  major  flaw  in  our
system..? And that was almost 20 years ago...

Here comes the mind f*ck
